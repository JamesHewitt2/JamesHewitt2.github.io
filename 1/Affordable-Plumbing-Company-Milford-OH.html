<p>Deterioration is a complex phenomenon and there are lots of aspects that speed up rust in the drinking-water distribution system and facility plumbing. For years, there has been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and corrosion, making it important to distinguish between naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is corrosive as it has a low pH and low TDS; nevertheless, cation -exchange water softening does not add to any factors that accelerate rust Likewise, there is a lack of clinical evidence supporting the claim that hard-water scale is an efficient kind of deterioration control. Therefore, thinking about all these factors, as well as results from research studies, WQA's position is that a properly set up cation -exchange water softener does not make water more corrosive.</p>
