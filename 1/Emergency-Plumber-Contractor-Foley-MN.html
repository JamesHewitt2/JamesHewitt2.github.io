<h3>Trusted Home Plumbing Services Foley MN</h3>
<p>Root Intrusion: Root intrusion refers to what takes place when tree roots begin to grow around and into your drain and sewer lines This takes place since the moisture in these lines is a natural fertilizer for tree roots. When roots eventually do piece your drain lines, they can trigger blockages, breaks, and back-ups which may result in comprehensive home damage. Look out for moist, green patches in your yard, a relentless sewage odor in or around your house, an uptick in rodent and insect activity, and slow drains, as these are all common indications of root invasion.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a process in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at as much as 3,500 PSI. This enables the sewer lines to be cleaned up quickly and effectively with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, producing from the reverse and forward jets in the nozzle, propel the hose through the line to eliminate particles such as difficult water scale, silt, grease, and sand deposits.</p>
