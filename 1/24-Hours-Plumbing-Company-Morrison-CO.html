Funneling occurs when the incoming tough water follows a narrow course through the softener's resin bed and does not exchange ions with the resin, leaving your water unsoftened.

<p>They do cost a fair bit more to install and buy, usually costing about twice that of a basic 50-gallon gas hot water heater. That being said, the expected lifespan of a tankless hot water heater is in between 15-20 years, which is almost double that of a tank-style.

<p>Some manufacturers declare that the electrical gadgets they produce can affect the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surface areas. Given that these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like standard water softeners do, one benefit declared for the user is the elimination of the need to include salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant growth promotion have actually been claimed, such systems do not eliminate minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only change the downstream results that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of certain systems has shown a decrease of calcium scale development. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>
