<p>Wooden pipes were utilized in London and in other places during the 17th and 16th centuries. The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a small hole in which the water would travel through. 21 The numerous pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wood pipes were used in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wood tubes were commonly used in the U.S.A. throughout the 20th century. These pipes (used in place of corrugated iron or reinforced concrete pipes) were made of sections cut from brief lengths of wood. Locking of adjacent rings with wood dowel pins produced a versatile structure. About 100,000 feet of these wood pipes were set up during WW2 in drainage culverts, storm sewers and conduits, under highways and at army camps, naval stations, airfields and ordnance plants.</p>
<p>Maintenance is another consideration. While you can buy models with special functions that do everything but add the salt, you will pay for each extra function. The tradeoff will be cost for convenience and you have no longterm assurance that the unique function will not fail. Depending on the water source, you may have to filter turbid water or disinfect bacteria-laden water-all before it even reaches the softening unit. Lastly, if you own a septic tank, you must consider the extra load on your drainage field from backwashing and regeneration. Estimates suggest that about 50 gallons of water are used for each regeneration cycle. This might or may not cause hydraulic overload of the septic system.</p>
<p>A minimum of when every 3 months, drain water from the tank. With time sediment develops at the bottom of the heater, which can hamper efficiency, and draining pipes a gallon approximately assists eliminate the sediment. If you identify a leak and select a patching job rather of a repiping task, just remember that all the pipes in your home are probably made from the very same material and they might be next. To avoid even more, more-costly repairs (like water damage from burst pipes), you may wish to consider repiping your entire home when you identify a leak.</p>
