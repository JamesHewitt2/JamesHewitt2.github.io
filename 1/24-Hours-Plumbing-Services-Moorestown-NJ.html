<p>As described earlier in the article, carbon monoxide is colorless and completely odor free. The only test for it is a carbon monoxide gas detector. Every house must have carbon monoxide detectors installed at the proper areas. In California, it is a requirement for all single and multi-family residences to have both smoke and carbon monoxide detectors. They are normally offered as a 2-in-1 detector and all new setups should have a 10-year non-serviceable type of detector.</p>

<p>Although these homeowners didn't feel fortunate at the time, it was certainly great timing to camera the line prior to collapsing. The pipe was in sufficient shape to reline before the problem worsened. Waiting simply wasn't an option. The line was 12 feet deep and went under a removed garage. At the least, it would have been a very pricey choice.</p>
