Current regulations restrict the quantity of water a toilet can use per flush to 1.28 gallons per flush which can leave debris accumulating in cast iron drain lines. We provide two kinds of water treatment systems for difficult water: Benefit Series Seawater Softeners and NaturSoft ® Water Softener Alternatives.</p>

<p>Almost all makes can identify the age of a water heater from the model and serial number. Have a licensed plumber determine whether it's up to present code and safely working. Ask the plumber to examine and record the size of the hot water heater when they're out to carry out the inspection, and whether it fulfills the requirements of the home.</p>
<p>Because the copper pipes have not had a chance to become covered within, New houses developed with copper pipes are particularly susceptible to corrosive water conditions. As advised by the MDH, it is best NOT to soften the water in a new home for a duration of three to 5 months after occupancy. This can be done by merely bypassing the water softener's filter medium. See your owner's manual for directions on bypassing your softener. Many new houses are built with PEX and not copper.</p>

<h3>Blocked Sewer in Havelock NC - Some Vital Info You Should Know</h3>
<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and included 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the past. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was rather reasonable. I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was very happy with their service.</p>
