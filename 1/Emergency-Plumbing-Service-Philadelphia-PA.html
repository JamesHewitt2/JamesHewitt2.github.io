Rather than a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively get used to your business' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high flow demand, tanks come on-line to add flow rate capacity. During durations of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new technique to softening is called progressive or responsive flow technology, and it's probably the most crucial development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>

<p>Rust is an intricate phenomenon and there are many aspects that speed up corrosion in the drinking-water distribution system and property plumbing. For years, there has been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and deterioration, making it essential to distinguish between naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is corrosive as it has a low pH and low TDS; nevertheless, cation -exchange water softening does not contribute to any aspects that accelerate corrosion Also, there is a lack of scientific evidence supporting the claim that hard-water scale is a reliable form of rust control. Hence, considering all these elements, along with results from research studies, WQA's position is that a properly configured cation -exchange water softener does not make water more corrosive.</p>
