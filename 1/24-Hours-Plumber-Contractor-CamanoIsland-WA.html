<p>We are a licensed and insured  drain cleaning contractor who can clean out hard drain obstructions and leave them working like new again. The typical cost to install a gas line for a kitchen stove is $15 to $25 per direct foot. Total costs range from $200 to $1,000 or more depending on the length of piping required to connect to the main gas supply, which generally averages 30'.</p>
<p>While numerous water heater problems can be efficiently fixed, some problems will require total hot water heater replacement. If your water heater is past its typical lifespan (usually anywhere from 8 to ten years or longer if you have a tankless hot water heater) or if it has a major leak or substantial rust, it might be time to think about replacement.</p>

Dark Blue = Supply-side pressure (for example, 100 psi) presses against the # 1 check and likewise fills the area on the "high pressure" side of the Relief Valve diaphram, pushing it closed.</p>
<p>Conventional tank-type water heaters consist of steel cylinders that are fed by a water pipe that dips into a big storage tank. The water inside this tank is heated up and after that launched into the pipes of your house through a hot-water pipe on top of the tank. Another pipe that emerges from the tank consists of the temperature and pressure-relief valve, which opens if you go beyond a preset level. You'll also discover a drain valve near the tank bottom, and a control unit outside for setting temperature levels and managing the pilot-light valve.</p>
