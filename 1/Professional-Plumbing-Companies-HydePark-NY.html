<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to run, the control valve or valves must stay open and the system must be constantly kept an eye on. For that reason, there is a device on each control valve that either avoids the valve from being closed or sends an alarm when it is closed.

Some systems make use of both approaches. NFPA 13 describes all such devices as supervisory gadgets.</p>
