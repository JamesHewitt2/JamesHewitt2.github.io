<p>The next step we should carry out in the repair process, is to flush the inbound water line. After we have actually cleaned up the body, and the repaired parts are still out of the body, and we have finished all of our part replacement and cleaning, we need to open the inlet turned off to flush any rust or debris. This can be difficult, specifically when the backflow prevention assembly is set up inside an area where water can not be wallowed. It is very important that the inlet valve be opened to flush this dirt and debris even if some sort of water collection system needs to be utilized to assure the line is appropriately flushed.</p>
