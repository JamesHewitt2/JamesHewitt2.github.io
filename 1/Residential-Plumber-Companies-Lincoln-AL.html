<p>Though water line replacement sounds like your home's equivalent of significant surgical treatment, it's actually something we at Gotelli Plumbing handle frequently. When your water lines are repiped, it simply means old copper and galvanized pipes are replaced with new pipes. We discover that houses 15 years or older who have never had repiping work are the most likely prospects for water line replacement. You might be in need of water line repiping if you have an older house and are experiencing significant and frequent leaks. We find that repiping can actually be the more affordable and better long-lasting service if you do have frequent leaks.</p>

The average cost of an aluminum garbage disposal ranges from $60 to $150, while a stainless-steel waste disposal unit has an average cost of simply over $150. Sewer pipes can be notoriously hard to trace, particularly on older residential or commercial properties, so you'll want to employ someone who will trace the issue at its source.</p>

Or it can be a much easier job where a single piece of pipe is switched out with a brand-new one.</p>
