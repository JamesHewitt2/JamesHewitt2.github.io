<h3>Resolution And Prevention Of Burst Pipes Levittown NY</h3>
<p>PEX pipes were thought to be a better option to polybutylene and galvanized piping. Unfortunately, one brand name is experiencing a lot of problems: Dura PEX. Dura PEX tends to have a lot of oxidization. This causes fractures in the tubing that can result in leaks. As these leakages take place, zinc is seeped from the fittings on the pipes, triggering them to degrade. Finally, chlorinated water has been discovered to trigger fractures in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the best option to all of these issues.</p>
