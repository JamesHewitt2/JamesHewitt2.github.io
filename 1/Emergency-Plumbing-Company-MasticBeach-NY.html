<p>Backpressure is produced when pressure in a water system surpasses the pressure in the safe and clean system supplying the cosmetics water. This can require the drinkable water to reverse its direction of flow through the cross-connection between the 2 systems. Possible contaminants can then get in the potable water supply. The best way to decrease build-up is have a professional flush it a minimum of when a year. In some locations of Virginia, where the water is specifically hard with high mineral content, you may need to flush the hot water heater regularly.</p>
<p>Sooner or later, however, the beads reach optimal capacity and can't attract anymore mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank should be regrowed, or, flushed clean.

Regrowth immediately starts when it reaches the preprogrammed setting. For a three-bedroom house and household of four, regrowth generally takes place every 12,000 gallons.</p>
