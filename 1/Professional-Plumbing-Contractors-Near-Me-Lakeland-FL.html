<p>PEX pipes were thought to be a better alternative to polybutylene and galvanized piping. Sadly, one brand is experiencing a lot of problems: Dura PEX. Dura PEX tends to have a great deal of oxidization. This causes cracks in the tubing that can cause leaks. As these leakages occur, zinc is seeped from the fittings on the pipes, triggering them to deteriorate. Lastly, chlorinated water has been discovered to cause cracks in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the best solution to all of these problems.</p>
