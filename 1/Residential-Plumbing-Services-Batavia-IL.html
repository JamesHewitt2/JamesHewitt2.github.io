If you irrigate with drinkable water, you are needed to have two backflow preventers, one at the meter and another one on the watering line at the point of connection.

<p>The source or location of a sewer problem determines who spends for repair. The City is responsible for the general public right-of-way (curb to suppress), from one side of the street to another. The homeowner is responsible for the area from the curb to the back of their home line. Easements (normally 10 feet broad) where main sewers traverse private property are an exception to this rule.</p>
<p>A home's service line (likewise referred to as a sewer lateral) ranges from the house to the mainline sewer in the street. In many cases, the property owner is responsible for keeping the service line from the home to the curb, and the City is responsible for keeping the mainline sewer and the part of the service line from the mainline sewer to the curb.</p>
<p>New houses constructed with copper pipes are specifically vulnerable to destructive water conditions due to the fact that the copper pipes have not had an opportunity to become coated within.

See your owner's manual for directions on bypassing your softener. Lots of brand-new homes are constructed with PEX and not copper.</p>

<h3>The Dreaded Blocked Toilet in Batavia IL</h3>
<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and added two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly dripped in the past. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done rapidly. The cost was quite reasonable. I will absolutely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was super pleased with their service.</p>
