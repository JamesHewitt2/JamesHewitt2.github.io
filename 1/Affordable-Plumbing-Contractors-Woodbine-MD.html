<p>Woodbury, in addition to numerous other neighborhoods and companies, has actually found the very best way to prevent these discolorations from happening is by reducing the number of times your water softener regrows.

However, many water softeners regrow frequently, when the filter medium really isn't full.

<p>CareSoft Elite ® is a high-grade water softener, geared up with a high-performance resin that easily minimizes the toughest of minerals. With a trademarked chlorine generator, our remarkable systems also provide an automatic cleaning cycle. The CARIX ® ion exchange procedure (Co2 Regenerated Ion EXchanger) permits a purposeful partial desalination and for that reason softening of drinking water including high amounts of hardeners, nitrate and sulfate.</p>
<p>In time, the resin beads in the water softener will become covered with calcium and magnesium ions, diminishing their capacity to soften tough water. Through a process called regeneration, water is instantly flushed through the water softener with a focused amount of regenerant. Now the resin beads pick up the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the solidity on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems feature an entire home water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener returns to service, supplying the whole house with clean, soft water.</p>
