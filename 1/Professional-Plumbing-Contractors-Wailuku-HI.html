<p>As the water treatment industry has actually grown in the U.S., the principle of water softening has frequently been misinterpreted as a purifying, cleansing or conditioning process. This is due largely to exaggerated advertising and, in part, to consumer misconceptions about water treatment.

The decision "to soften or not to soften" is a matter of individual choice not need. Nevertheless, water softening does have advantages, and drawbacks, that make this choice a considerable one.</p>
