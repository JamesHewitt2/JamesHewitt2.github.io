<p>Hard water is softened by getting rid of the calcium and magnesium it consists of. When tough water goes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (firmness) ions are eliminated through an ion exchange process, so only softened water goes through to your home. As soon as the resin bed fills up with firmness ions, it must be regenerated (cleaned). Salt is generally utilized in the regeneration process and brings back the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange procedure can start again.</p>
