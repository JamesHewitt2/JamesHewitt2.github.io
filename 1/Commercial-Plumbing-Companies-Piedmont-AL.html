<p>To lower the need of gas line repair, it is necessary to understand the typical reasons for gas leaks.

This is due to the fact that homes are not sufficiently ventilated during the cooler months to prevent heat loss. If you have not done so already, we advise setting up carbon monoxide gas detectors beyond bed room doors to alert you of any possible gas leaks.</p>

<p>I had a major sewer problem with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I started calling any number I might find on Google. I in fact got their number for another company that could not come soon enough but referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and provide me a quote. They right away cleared the preliminary blockage, enabling the occupants to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon further investigation, there was a significant obstruction that needed excavation to investigate. His group was on site the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this initial issue and setting up a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed. This took place yet a third time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
