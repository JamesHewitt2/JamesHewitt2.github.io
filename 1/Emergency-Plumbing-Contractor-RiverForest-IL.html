<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's potable water system.

Boosts in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in safe and clean water system pressure take place whenever the amount of water being used surpasses the amount of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
