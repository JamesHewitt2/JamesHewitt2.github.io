Water softening means expanding the life expectancy of household machine, such as laundry machines, and the life expectancy of pipelines.

<p>Water softeners work through a procedure called ion exchange which gets rid of calcium and magnesium from the water. When the tough water enters into the mineral tank, it flows through a bed of spherical resin beads These plastic beads, typically made from polystyrene, are charged with a salt ion. The resin beads are anions, implying they have an unfavorable charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a positive charge, making them cations. Since opposite charges draw in, the unfavorable charge of the minerals is brought in to the favorable charge of the resin beads. As the hard water travels through the resin, the beads get ahold of the mineral ions and remove them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the salt ion is launched. The column of resin strips all the hardness out of the water as it travels through the mineral tank, and softened water drains into your house.</p>
