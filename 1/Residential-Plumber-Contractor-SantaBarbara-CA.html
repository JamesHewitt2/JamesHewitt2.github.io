<p>To determine which toilet valve is causing the trouble, take a look at the overflow tube. There's an issue with the toilet fill valve if water is overruning into the tube. If the water level is listed below the top of television, the flush valve is leaking, enabling water to trickle into the bowl. That sluggish, consistent outflow of water prevents the fill valve from closing totally. We cut away the fronts and backs of brand-new toilets to reveal you how to replace these toilet tank parts. Your toilet and toilet tank parts will not look so pristine inside. You'll find scummy surface areas, water spots and rust. But don't be squeamish-- the water is as clean as the stuff that comes out of your faucets.</p>
