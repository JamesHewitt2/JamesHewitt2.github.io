<p>The Plumbing and Gas Piping Program IVR system is now accepting inspection requests. In time, like any other device in your house, your garbage disposal. might need repairs. A disposal system may start or clog to leak through heavy, or improper, use. A leak someplace in the system may suggest a worn seal.

Tank covers can break and leave your toilet's inner operations exposed if mishandled.
