<p>Corrosion is a complicated phenomenon and there are many aspects that accelerate corrosion in the drinking-water distribution system and property plumbing. For many years, there has been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and rust, making it essential to compare naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is corrosive as it has a low pH and low TDS; nevertheless, cation -exchange water softening does not add to any aspects that accelerate deterioration Likewise, there is a lack of clinical proof supporting the claim that hard-water scale is an efficient type of corrosion control. Thus, thinking about all these elements, along with arise from research studies, WQA's position is that an appropriately configured cation -exchange water softener does not make water more destructive.</p>
<p>As the water treatment industry has actually grown in the U.S., the idea of water softening has actually frequently been misinterpreted as a purifying, cleansing or conditioning process.

The decision "to soften or not to soften" is a matter of personal choice not need. However, water softening does have benefits, and downsides, that make this decision a significant one.</p>
