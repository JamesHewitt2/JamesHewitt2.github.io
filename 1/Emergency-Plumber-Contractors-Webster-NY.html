<p>Gradually, the resin beads in the water softener will end up being covered with calcium and magnesium ions, lessening their capability to soften hard water. Through a process called regrowth, water is instantly flushed through the water softener with a concentrated amount of regenerant. Now the resin beads get the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the solidity on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems feature a whole home water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain. With the resin beads charged," the water softener goes back to service, supplying the whole house with clean, soft water.</p>
<p>Often you understand you have a sewer line break due to the fact that you can smell nasty smells or you have a sewage back-up in your home. It is important to determine the specific place of the break in your sewer line. Often times the break can be on the city side of the sewer line and understanding this can conserve you countless dollars in repairs. Simply sharing a copy of your sewer line video with the city inspector can resolve the problem. The professionals and plumbers at Jim Dandy Sewer and Plumbing can make a copy of your sewer scope video on a thumb drive so that you always have a copy for your insurance company, real estate agent or city inspector.</p>
<p>Other signs you might need to repipe consist of rust in your water system, low water pressure, and damp spots in your walls, floor, or ceiling. While these are common indications that precede repiping services, they do not always imply repiping is the only service. Contact our Brenham plumbers and we will have a look at the issue to identify the best strategy.</p>
