<p>In 1939, after his Roto-Rooter sewer cleaning machine proved successful, Sam Blanc designed and developed a smaller design that ran on the exact same principle but might clean and clear bathroom and kitchen sink drains along with laundry drains and other household plumbing drains. Blanc also constructed a much bigger version of the Roto-Rooter machine called the Roto-Rooter Royal. It had to be hauled by a truck and featured a 10 hp gasoline engine and 1000 feet of steel cable television. It was capable of cleaning big commercial and municipal sewer pipes. An enhanced version called "The Mainliner" was presented in 1958 that could also thread telephone cable television. It was stopped in 1973.</p>
