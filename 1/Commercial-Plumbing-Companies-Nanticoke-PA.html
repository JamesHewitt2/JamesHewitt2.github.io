<p>As the name suggests, a backflow preventer works to ensure that liquids do not recede versus the needed instructions of flow. When used in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is utilized to make sure that water does not stream from the sprinkler system back into the community supply of water, or other source of drinking water. Sadly, water kept in the lawn sprinkler can become polluted. There is potential for the polluted water to end up being a health threat if enabled to re-enter the water supply. The backflow preventer is planned to avoid water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be examined frequently for efficiency, as well as checked each year by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
