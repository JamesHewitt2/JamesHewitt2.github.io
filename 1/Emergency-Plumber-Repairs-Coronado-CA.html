<p>A partial reroute is generally a little scale repiping of several affected areas of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost reliable, it is possible to just abandon the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, ceilings and walls. Costing less than a complete repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can add up in cost really rapidly. This is the main reason that we will recommend a complete repipe in particular communities, based upon our experience.</p>

Depending upon the length of time the water travels through the ground prior to reaching your tap, it can pick up a lot of these minerals, making water harder in some areas than others. While the minerals won't harm your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water inappropriate-- and quite a nuisance-- for its lots of desired usages around your house.</p>
