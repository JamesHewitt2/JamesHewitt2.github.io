<h3>Working Consistently With Your Emergency Plumber Dedham MA</h3>
<p>Zurn Industries: In addition to offering a substantial line of backflow preventers, most of Zurn Wilkins' plumbing fixtures satisfy and surpass the standards established by the Safe Drinking Water Act and lead-free effort. Recent changes to the Safe Drinking Water Act mandated that all commercial plumbing fixtures, valves, pipes, and fittings that are directly planned for human water usage are required to be manufactured with less than 0.25 percent leaded brass content. Zurn Wilkins plumbing products that fall within this classification have actually been designated lead-free," indicating they are certified.</p>
<p>Mechanical backflow preventers have internal seals, springs and moving parts that undergo fouling, wear or fatigue. Also, mechanical backflow preventers and air spaces can be bypassed. Therefore, all backflow preventers need to be tested periodically to ensure they are working appropriately. A visual check of air spaces is sufficient, but mechanical backflow preventers have to be evaluated with properly calibrated gauge devices.</p>
