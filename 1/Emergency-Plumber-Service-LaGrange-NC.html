<h3>Fixing A Clogged Toilet at LaGrange NC</h3>
<p>What is hard water? Clinically speaking, it is water that contains substantial amounts of dissolved minerals, specifically calcium and magnesium. As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it picks up these minerals on its journey. Depending on the length of time the water travels through the ground prior to reaching your tap, it can pick up a great deal of these minerals, making water harder in some regions than others. While the minerals won't damage your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water inappropriate-- and quite a problem-- for its numerous intended usages around your home.</p>

<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is just half the formula! To simply put some media inside a tank and expect the best is common in our industry and lots of companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Again, years of experience and extensive testing led us to develop a tank that fluidizes the media bed much better than any other style on the market. Fluidization is the key to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media converts the solidity in the water to calcite crystals which will not stick to anything even under severe temperatures. It's only with the media and the fluidization effectively interacting that you can accomplish this.</p>
