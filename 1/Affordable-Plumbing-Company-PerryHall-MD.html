<p>Backpressure is created when pressure in a water system goes beyond the pressure in the safe and clean system providing the make-up water. This can force the potable water to reverse its direction of flow through the cross-connection between the two systems. Potential pollutants can then enter the drinkable water system. The very best way to reduce build-up is have a professional flush it at least as soon as a year. In some areas of Virginia, where the water is specifically hard with high mineral content, you might need to flush the hot water heater regularly.</p>
