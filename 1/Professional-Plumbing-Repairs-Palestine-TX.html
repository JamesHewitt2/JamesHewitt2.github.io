<p>When deciding on the proper system protection there are a number of factors to consider we need to take a look at. In my mind there is no one size fits all scenarios in the cross-connection world. Each and every installation must be taken a look at on a specific basis as a special stand-alone system. The National Fire Protection Association NFPA 13 Standard for the installation of lawn sprinkler contains the requirement for the lawn sprinkler themselves. Fire protection system are designed to match the threat that exists in the places they are set up in. As structure types and contents of these buildings can be really different, we need to comprehend that the fire defense system for any installation needs to be developed and set up to meet that specific hazard or need. An aircraft hangar will need a really various fire security system than the system needed in an apartment building. The backflow protection requirements for these 2 examples would also differ considerably.</p>
