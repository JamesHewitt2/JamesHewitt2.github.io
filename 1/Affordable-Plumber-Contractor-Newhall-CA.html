<p>A backflow preventer is a means or mechanism to prevent backflow. The standard ways of preventing backflow is an air space, which either eliminates a cross-connection or provides a barrier to backflow. The fundamental system for preventing backflow is a mechanical backflow preventer, which supplies a physical barrier to backflow. The principal types of mechanical backflow preventer are the reduced-pressure concept assembly, the pressure vacuum breaker assembly, and the check valve assembly. A secondary kind of mechanical backflow preventer is the residential dual check valve.</p>
