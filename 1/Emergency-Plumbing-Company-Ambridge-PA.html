<h3>Licensed Plumbing & HVAC Company In Ambridge PA</h3>
<p>Hard water can trash havoc on your home's plumbing and home appliances by triggering scale buildup in your pipes, blocking them and the aerators. When this occurs it will trigger a reduction in the water pressure and likewise drastically decreases the life-span of all household home appliances. Water leaks: If you observe a leak in your pipes, there may be other leaks you are unaware of. Leaks are a sure indication that your pipes are worn and old and need to be replaced. Rather than needing to continuously repair them, the very best alternative. is to replace them.</p>
<p>Water softeners overcome a procedure called ion exchange which removes calcium and magnesium from the water. When the hard water enters into the mineral tank, it streams through a bed of spherical resin beads These plastic beads, normally made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion. The resin beads are anions, indicating they have a negative charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a favorable charge, making them cations. Given that opposite charges attract, the unfavorable charge of the minerals is brought in to the favorable charge of the resin beads. As the hard water travels through the resin, the beads get ahold of the mineral ions and remove them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the sodium ion is launched. The column of resin strips all the solidity out of the water as it passes through the mineral tank, and softened water drains into your house.</p>
