<p>Water softeners leaks are primarily triggered due to the fact that of an issue at the point of installation or due to the fact that of maintenance. When installing the plumbing to your softener, take your time and ensure your fittings are threaded well and your push-to-connect fittings are seated correctly. It can likewise trigger the system to leak if the bypass valve is split. Bypass valves are fitted with -rings that may need to be re-lubricated or replaced over time. A split rotor valve or rotor valve seal might also be the perpetrator. The rotor valve directs the water throughout the system throughout softening and regrowth processes. A worn water valve can lock up and spring a leak. It is likely split and simply needs to be replaced if the rotor valve's seal is leaking.</p>
<p>Mechanical backflow preventers have internal seals, springs and moving parts that are subject to fouling, wear or fatigue. Also, mechanical backflow preventers and air gaps can be bypassed. For that reason, all backflow preventers need to be checked periodically to ensure they are functioning effectively. A visual check of air gaps suffices, but mechanical backflow preventers need to be evaluated with appropriately calibrated gauge devices.</p>
