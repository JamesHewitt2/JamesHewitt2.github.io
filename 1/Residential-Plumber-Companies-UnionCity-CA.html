<p>Wood pipes were used in London and elsewhere throughout the 16th and 17th centuries. The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a little hole in which the water would travel through. 21 The several pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wooden pipes were utilized in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wood tubes were widely utilized in the U.S.A. during the 20th century. These pipes (used in place of corrugated iron or strengthened concrete pipes) were made from areas cut from short lengths of wood. Locking of adjacent rings with wood dowel pins produced a versatile structure.

All assemblies should be secured from freezing temperature levels and if installed where temperatures will reach 100 degrees F or above, a hot water type assembly need to be utilized. Speak with makers specs for suggestions. When searching for plumbing services in the area, be specific with your needs and ask prospects if they are licensed plumbers and if they have the sophisticated experience and licenses connected with a plumbing contractor.</p>
