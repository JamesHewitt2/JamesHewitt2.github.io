<p>Backflow preventers are critical for creating a safe water supply system. No matter which model you pick, all water softeners need to be effectively maintained. The brine service must be combined and kept in the salt water tank. Regular blocking of the resin also needs special attention.

If not, gradually stir the resin during the backwash cycle to help break up the material. Similarly, germs and fungi also form mats in the resin that lower its efficiency. Disinfecting the water prior to softening or periodically cleaning the softener with chlorine bleach will get rid of these problems. Nevertheless, read the maker's guidelines before including any chemicals to the system.</p>
