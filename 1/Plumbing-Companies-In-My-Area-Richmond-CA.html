<h3>Most Effective Drain Cleaning Methods Richmond CA</h3>
<p>Root Invasion: Root intrusion describes what takes place when tree roots start to grow around and into your drain and sewer lines This takes place due to the fact that the wetness in these lines is a natural fertilizer for tree roots. When roots eventually do piece your drain lines, they can cause obstructions, breaks, and back-ups which might lead to extensive residential or commercial property damage. Keep an eye out for wet, green patches in your lawn, a consistent sewage smell in or around your home, an uptick in rodent and insect activity, and sluggish drains, as these are all common indications of root invasion.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a procedure in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at approximately 3,500 PSI. This permits the sewer lines to be cleaned rapidly and effectively with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, producing from the reverse and forward jets in the nozzle, propel the hose through the line to get rid of particles such as difficult water scale, sand, silt, and grease deposits.</p>
