<p>Pipeline video inspection is a type of telepresence utilized to visually inspect the interiors of pipelines, plumbing systems, and storm drains A typical application is for a plumber to identify the condition of little size sewer lines and household connection drain pipes. With special root nozzles, we can clean and clear the majority of the roots, rust, and debris to prepare the line for possible CIPP lining reinstatement if the pipe needs to be fixed.

<p>Home water softeners, also called ion exchange systems, are home appliances that get rid of calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for salt or potassium.

After passing through the beads, the resulting chloride service ends up being a waste stream that decreases the drain and eventually into the environment.</p>
