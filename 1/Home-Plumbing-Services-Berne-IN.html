<h3>Leaky Faucets in Berne IN - Renewing Valve Seats and Sealing Stems</h3>
<p>Button Plumbing was excellent. They replaced my kitchen faucet and included 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly leaked in the past if I shut off the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was rather affordable. I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was very happy with their service.</p>
