<p>Because of the inherent design of a minimized pressure backflow assembly, fluctuating supply pressure on a very low flow or fixed circulation condition might trigger annoyance dripping and possible fouling of the assembly. While ineffective in all cases, the installation of a soft seated check valve instantly ahead of the RPZ will typically hold the pressure consistent to the assembly in times of varying supply pressure.</p>
<p>A. The toilet fill valve measurements we reveal are determined from the within bottom of the tank to the top of the fill valve. The threaded supply of water shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not consisted of in this measurement.
