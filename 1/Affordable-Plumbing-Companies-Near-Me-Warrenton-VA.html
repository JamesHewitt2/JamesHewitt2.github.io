Solder on any nipples and fittings before connecting the system to the bypass valve to prevent melting the plastic if you are using copper pipes. Seal all threads with plumber's tape.

<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health risk for individuals on low salt diet plans. Ion exchange increases the quantity of salt in water, in order to decrease its mineral content. Generally, this process adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how tough the water was to begin with. Harder water will result in more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this boost in sodium is minor, however if you have actually been recommended by a doctor to follow a stringent low sodium diet plan this boost can pose problems.</p>
