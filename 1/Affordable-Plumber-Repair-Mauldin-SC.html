<p>If your polybutylene pipes have actually stopped working, read your insurance policy completely. Make sure you understand what is covered and what is not covered. Numerous insurer will not cover a sluggish leak. Claims might be denied due to the fact that the standard HO-3 property owners' policy particularly excludes "a loss as the outcome of a water leak over a prolonged time period."
