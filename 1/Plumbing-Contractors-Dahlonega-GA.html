Supplied there isn't a tank failure, normally a commercial water heater can be repaired, however is it worth fixing? Just after addressing the following concerns must you answer repair or replace. Do you understand how many years old your water heater is? Do you know the number of years it's ranked for? If it is close to the variety of years the water heater was ranked for, think about replacement rather of repair.</p>
<p>Water temperature problems can be fixed by changing the temperature level on the water heater. Low water pressure from a sink faucet might be caused by a blocked aerator screen.
