<p>Though water line replacement sounds like your house's equivalent of major surgery, it's in fact something we at Gotelli Plumbing handle regularly. When your water lines are repiped, it just suggests old copper and galvanized pipes are replaced with brand-new pipes. We find that houses 15 years or older who have never had repiping work are the most likely candidates for water line replacement. You might be in need of water line repiping if you have an older home and are experiencing significant and regular leaks. We find that repiping can in fact be the cheaper and better long-term solution if you do have regular leaks.</p>
<p>Water softeners can be found in all shapes and sizes and bigger definitely does not indicate much better. WaterBoss ® utilizes great mesh resin - smaller sized beads that actually provide more surface area to soften water. This resin is vacuum-packed to allow optimal capability in a minimum of space. Plus, our patented Directional Flow Screen system helps ensure that no resin bead goes unused. Our screens and whole-house dirt and sediment filter also safeguard the resin bed, so we don't need to squander space on freeboard" which is the empty area in conventional water softeners that allow a churning of resin throughout regeneration to release sediment, firmness and dirt.</p>
<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is just half the equation! To just put some media inside a tank and hope for the best is typical in our industry and numerous companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Once again, years of experience and extensive testing led us to create a tank that fluidizes the media bed much better than any other style on the market. Fluidization is the key to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media converts the solidity in the water to calcite crystals which will not stay with anything even under severe temperature levels. It's only with the media and the fluidization effectively interacting that you can accomplish this.</p>
