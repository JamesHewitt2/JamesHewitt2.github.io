<p>Many homes or buildings that were constructed in the 1970s typically have galvanized piping. With time, the plumbing system can wear out and the pipes can begin to corrode. This can cause low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to provide weather defense. As the external coating of zinc begins to wear down, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, causing the iron to eventually rust.</p>

While these are common indications that precede repiping services, they do not necessarily indicate repiping is the only option.
