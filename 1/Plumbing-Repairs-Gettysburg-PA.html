<p>If your water heater has needed multiple repairs over the last couple of years, it may be time to get it changed. A great general rule for water heaters is this: due to the fact that the life-span of the typical hot water heater is between 8-12 years, around 5-6 years is the halfway point. It makes more financial sense to replace your water heater if the cost of a repair is more than half the cost of a replacement at that point.</p>
<p>Prior to selection and installation, refer to manufacturers literature for temperature ranges. All assemblies need to be safeguarded from freezing temperature levels and if set up where temperature levels will reach 100 degrees F or above, a hot water type assembly must be utilized. Seek advice from makers requirements for recommendations. When looking for plumbing services in the area, be specific with your requirements and ask candidates if they are licensed plumbers and if they have the advanced experience and licenses associated with a plumbing contractor.</p>
