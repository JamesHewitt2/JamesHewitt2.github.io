When you do not notice the water was off for a few minutes, frequently it occurs at night. An example is when the public utility has to shut off the water to repair a water pipe, or hook up a new pipe. This makes construction tasks quickly the most typical cause of backflow problems. Fire fighting is another typical cause of backflow. Fire trucks use big pumps to suck the water out of the fire hydrants.
