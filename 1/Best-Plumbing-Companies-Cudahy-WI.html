<p>In water distribution systems, water is typically kept at a substantial pressure to make it possible for water to stream from the tap, shower, or other component. Water pressure might fail or be decreased when a water pipe bursts, pipes freeze, or there is all of a sudden high need on the water supply (for instance, when numerous fire hydrants are opened). Reduced pressure in the pipe might permit infected water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be prepared into the system.</p>
