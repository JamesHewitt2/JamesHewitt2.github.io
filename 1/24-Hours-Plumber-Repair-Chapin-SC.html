<p>Water softeners leaks are mostly triggered since of a problem at the point of installation or since of maintenance. When setting up the plumbing to your softener, take your time and ensure your fittings are threaded well and your push-to-connect fittings are seated properly. If the bypass valve is broken, it can also cause the system to leak. Bypass valves are fitted with -rings that might need to be re-lubricated or replaced with time. A broken rotor valve or rotor valve seal may also be the culprit. The rotor valve directs the water throughout the system throughout softening and regeneration procedures. A used water valve can lock up and spring a leak. If the rotor valve's seal is leaking, it is likely split and merely needs to be replaced.</p>
