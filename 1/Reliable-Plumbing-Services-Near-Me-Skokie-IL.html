Indoor gas leakages from heaters, ranges, ovens and other gas-burning home appliances take place most frequently in the winter.

If you haven't done so already, we suggest setting up carbon monoxide detectors beyond bed room doors to alert you of any possible gas leaks.</p>

The pipe is usually 1/2 to 1-inch in diameter. Often, it goes into the home near the hot water heater. Your main shut down is connected to completion of the water main.
