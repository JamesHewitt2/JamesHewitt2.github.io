Water pressure may stop working or be decreased when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is unexpectedly high demand on the water supply (for example, when several fire hydrants are opened).

<p>If you're buying a new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large majority of toilets, the drain is centered about 12 in. from the wall. However with a couple of models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To inspect the rough-in, just measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't around 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. Most house centers bring just one or more 10-in. models and no 14-in. designs. If you have to special-order a toilet, be prepared to invest far more. Likewise determine how far the bowl protrudes from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are changing a toilet with a basic bowl with an elongated" design, the door might not close. Continue reading to find out how to install a toilet.</p>
