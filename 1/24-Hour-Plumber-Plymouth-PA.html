<p>PEX pipes were thought to be a much better alternative to galvanized and polybutylene piping. Sadly, one brand is experiencing a great deal of problems: Dura PEX. Dura PEX tends to have a lot of oxidization. This causes cracks in the tubing that can lead to leaks. As these leaks happen, zinc is seeped from the fittings on the pipes, causing them to weaken. Lastly, chlorinated water has actually been discovered to trigger cracks in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the very best option to all of these problems.</p>
