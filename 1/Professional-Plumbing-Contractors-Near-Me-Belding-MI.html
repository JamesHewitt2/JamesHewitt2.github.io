Its sole task is to prevent drinking water from being infected due to backflow.</p>
<p>A backflow preventer is a method or mechanism to avoid backflow. The standard methods of avoiding backflow is an air gap, which either removes a cross-connection or provides a barrier to backflow. The basic system for avoiding backflow is a mechanical backflow preventer, which provides a physical barrier to backflow. The principal kinds of mechanical backflow preventer are the reduced-pressure concept assembly, the pressure vacuum breaker assembly, and the double check valve assembly. A secondary type of mechanical backflow preventer is the residential dual check valve.</p>
