<p>A partial reroute is generally a little scale repiping of one or more afflicted locations of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost efficient, it is possible to just desert the afflicted section of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, ceilings and walls. Costing less than a full repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can accumulate in cost extremely quickly. This is the main reason why we will advise a complete repipe in certain areas, based upon our experience.</p>

If your fill valve is broken, not set at the right level, or isn't installed effectively, you may experience a frequently or continuously "running" toilet - which can cost you numerous dollars in wasted water.</p>
