<p>Wire the disposal. Some disposals feature device wires attached, and others do not.

When turned on, your disposal unit pulls down wastewater and any product debris by centrifugal force. But it does not shred such particles. Instead, it grinds it into a paste at high speed so that it can quickly stream into the drain pipe in addition to the rest of your wastewater.</p>
