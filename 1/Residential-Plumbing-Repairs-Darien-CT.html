<p>A water softener should be set up as close to the water's point of entry into your house as possible. This ensures most of your plumbing and appliances are reaping the benefits of carrying the softened water. It's especially important to make certain your water softener is located before your hot water heater, as difficult water does the greatest damage to hot water appliances. You will want to install the softener in a dry, level place, like a basement or garage. It will need to be near the water's main line, an electric outlet to turn on the system, and a drain for the salt water service from the regeneration cycle.</p>
<p>Water softeners, like the CareSoft Pro, work by removing an abundance of calcium and magnesium from water. Sediment from these components not only dry your skin and hair but also develop in devices and pipes reducing their efficiency and life span. Your washing machine, water and dishwasher heater are all negatively impacted by hard water. The impacts of hard water can be seen on your meals, the color and softness of your clothing, the film on your shower door and even your personal appearance and convenience.</p>
