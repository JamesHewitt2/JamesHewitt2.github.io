<p>When a garbage disposal breaks, it is most likely only a matter of time before your sink begins to clog, as you and other house members are most likely not used to ensuring that no obstructive food waste goes down your drain. Those dissolved solids can cause a flaky accumulation on whatever from meals, to pipes, to the heating aspects of your home appliances, to your own body. Soap scum and clogged, corroded plumbing are typically the result of tough water.</p>
