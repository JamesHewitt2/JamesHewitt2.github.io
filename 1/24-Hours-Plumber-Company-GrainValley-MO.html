<p>Badly set up gas lines cause gas leakages. Gas leakages are pricey to repair. Gas line installation is not a diy job. The gas lines have to be calibrated to the ideal levels by a certified professional. The US Department of Energy says that water heating can represent 14% -25% of the energy consumed in your house." It is the 2nd greatest energy consuming area of a house, next to heating and cooling. The quantity of minerals dissolved in water can trigger it to take longer for water to heat, increasing those energy expenses.</p>
