<p>If you're buying a brand-new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast majority of toilets, the drain is centered about 12 in. from the wall. But with a couple of models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, simply measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. A lot of home centers carry just one or 2 10-in. designs and no 14-in. designs. If you need to special-order a toilet, be prepared to invest much more. If there's a door near the toilet, also measure how far the bowl extends from the wall. If you are changing a toilet with a basic bowl with an elongated" design, the door may not close. Read on to learn how to install a toilet.</p>

I actually got their number for another company that could not come quickly enough however referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to examine and provide me a quote. They immediately cleared the preliminary blockage, enabling the tenants to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon more investigation, there was a significant clog that required excavation to investigate. His team was on site the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this preliminary concern and setting up a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a third time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
