<p>Backflow indicates the undesirable reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the potable supply of water; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from occurring. Points at which a drinkable water supply connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in home appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, but they should be carefully designed and set up to prevent backflow. Another typical location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>
