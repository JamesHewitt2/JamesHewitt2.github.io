<p>To minimize the need of gas line repair, it is very important to understand the typical reasons for gas leaks. Indoor gas leaks from heaters, stoves, ovens and other gas-burning devices happen most commonly in the winter season. Since houses are not sufficiently ventilated throughout the cooler months to prevent heat loss, this is. We advise setting up carbon monoxide detectors outside of bedroom doors to inform you of any potential gas leaks if you haven't done so already.</p>
