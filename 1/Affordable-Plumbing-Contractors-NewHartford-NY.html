<h3>Plumber Installation & Repair Service NewHartford NY</h3>
<p>We truly appreciate our consumers and the services that we offer. As hard water passes through a softener, the calcium and magnesium trade locations with sodium ions (Figure 1). Sodium ions are held loosely and are replaced quickly by calcium and magnesium ions. Throughout this process, totally free" salt ions are launched into the water. The time between charging cycles depends on the solidity of the water, the amount of water utilized, the size of the unit and the capability of the exchange media to remove solidity.</p>
<p>Water softeners overcome a process called ion exchange which removes calcium and magnesium from the water. When the difficult water enters into the mineral tank, it flows through a bed of round resin beads These plastic beads, typically made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion. The resin beads are anions, suggesting they have a negative charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a positive charge, making them cations. Because opposite charges draw in, the unfavorable charge of the minerals is drawn in to the favorable charge of the resin beads. As the difficult water travels through the resin, the beads grab ahold of the mineral ions and eliminate them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the salt ion is released. The column of resin strips all the hardness out of the water as it travels through the mineral tank, and softened water drains into your house.</p>
