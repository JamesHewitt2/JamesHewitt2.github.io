<p>Your sewer line is among the most vital parts of your household plumbing - and if it ends up being damaged or clogged, it could wreak unwanted concerns on your property. Water heater repair can sometimes be cost-prohibitive. You'll pay for the necessary repairs only to deal with another issue shortly afterwards. No matter what kind of hot water heater you have or have an interest in, the specialists at Timothy Off can help. Contact us today for our water heater installation services. For example, if your kitchen sink is backed up since you flushed potato peels down the disposal, a fast drain snaking can separate the obstruction and send it down the pipes. We suggest you choose drain snaking instead of using strong chemical drain cleaners. These store-bought cleaners might do more damage than great by corroding your pipes.</p>
