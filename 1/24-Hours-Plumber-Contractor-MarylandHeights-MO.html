<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>House owners can ask for a plumbing inspection at any time, but it is specifically prudent to arrange inspections on an annual basis and when acquiring a new home.

<p>A partial reroute is basically a small scale repiping of one or more affected areas of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost effective, it is possible to just abandon the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, walls and ceilings. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can build up in cost really quickly. This is the main reason we will recommend a full repipe in particular areas, based on our experience.</p>
