<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>House owners can ask for a plumbing inspection at any time, but it is specifically prudent to arrange inspections on an annual basis and when acquiring a new home.

<p>A partial reroute is basically a small scale repiping of one or more affected areas of the plumbing underneath the slab.

Costing less than a complete repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can build up in cost really quickly. This is the main reason we will recommend a full repipe in particular areas, based on our experience.</p>
