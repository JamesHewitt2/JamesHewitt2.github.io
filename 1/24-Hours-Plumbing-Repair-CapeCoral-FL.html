<p>To prep your unit for installation, you might have to connect a cord with a plug to reach the outlet, or extension wires to reach a hardwired box In this case, I connected a cable with a plug package that I bought independently from the disposal unit.

<p>Although these homeowners didn't feel lucky at the time, it was certainly great timing to camera the line prior to collapsing. The pipe was in good enough shape to reline prior to the issue worsened. Waiting simply wasn't an alternative. The line was 12 feet deep and went under a removed garage. At the least, it would have been an extremely expensive alternative.</p>
