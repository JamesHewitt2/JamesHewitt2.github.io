<p>Loose flanges are normally the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws simply will not keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best solution depends on the degree of the rot. Utilize an ear-type repair ring if the rot is only under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into company wood farther away from the flange. Before you install this kind of ring, hold it approximately the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might have to cut off a number of ears to make it work with your toilet. You'll have to replace a section of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>

<p>Backflow preventers should only be repaired when the information gathered from the field test shows the assembly has broken down in its efficiency below the developed minimum basic. The test treatment is a diagnostic examination of the operations of a backflow preventer. When the backflow preventer stops working to meet this minimum standard, the backflow preventer must be fixed or if required, changed. These minimum standards are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly begins to weaken in its performance, it can still prevent backflow. The function of a repair is to return the assembly back to its initial factory working specs. This suggests the assembly is repaired so that it can perform above the minimum requirement.</p>
