<p>We're changing a natural gas water heater in our demonstration. The actions for changing a lp water heater are exactly the same, and those for an electric hot water heater are comparable. Repeating leaks and repairs. If your hot water heater is over 10 years old, it has actually likely lost much of its performance; continuing to repair it, with its regular breakdowns, is not economical in the long run. As an outcome, we recommend replacing your unit if it is over ten years old.</p>

A lot of high-pressure water jetters will run with approximately 4,000 PSI of pressure and will press anywhere from 2-18 gallons of water per minute through a pipe.</p>
