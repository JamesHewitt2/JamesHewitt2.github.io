<p>Gradually, the resin beads in the water softener will end up being covered with calcium and magnesium ions, reducing their capability to soften hard water. Through a process called regeneration, water is immediately flushed through the water softener with a concentrated quantity of regenerant. Now the resin beads pick up the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the hardness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems include a whole house water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain. With the resin beads charged," the water softener goes back to service, providing the whole house with clean, soft water.</p>
