<p>Sewer lines can fail for a variety of reasons, including bad soil conditions, obstructions from grease and grime, and rust.

<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in safe and clean supply of water pressure occur whenever the amount of water being used surpasses the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
