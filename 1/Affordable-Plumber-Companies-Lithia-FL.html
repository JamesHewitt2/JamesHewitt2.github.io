<p>Concealed water leakages are frequently difficult and have Possibly Severe Repercussions. Replacing your flapper might need somewhat different steps than we reveal (Photos 2 and 3). Your flapper might screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. If you have an uncommon flush valve, finding a replacement flapper might be the hardest part of the job. To discover an appropriate replacement, shut off the water, take the old one with you to the home center or hardware store. (Turn off the water prior to removing the flapper.) You may not discover a similar match, but chances are you'll locate one of the exact same shape and diameter.
