Call a Sears Handyman agent today to discuss repair choices.</p>
<p>A water softener works by using electrical charges to remove the minerals. Calcium, magnesium and many other minerals carry favorable charges, so water softeners utilize salt ions, which are "exchanged" with the calcium and magnesium ions. If you irrigate with safe and clean water, you are required to have two backflow preventers, one at the meter and another one on the irrigation line at the point of connection. If you have 2 meters, potable and watering, you are also required to have 2 backflow preventers, one at each meter.</p>

<p>A water softener is a whole-house filtration system that removes hardness-causing calcium and magnesium minerals from your water through a procedure called ion exchange.  A water softener addresses one of the most prevalent and destructive water problems: hard water.  Tough water wreaks havoc on the modern-day house. Scale builds up in your pipes, clogging them and reducing water pressure.  Scale dramatically shortens the lifespan of devices like dishwashers, coffee machine and ice devices. Tough water destroys warm water devices. The greater the temperature of the water, the more calcium and magnesium will strengthen and harden into strong deposits inside your warm water heater.</p>
