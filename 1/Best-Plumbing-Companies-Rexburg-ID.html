<p>A backflow preventer stops water inside your water pipes from receding to the City system if pressure is lost. Backflow can contaminate the water system. The basic system for avoiding backflow is a mechanical backflow prevention device, which supplies a physical barrier to backflow. All leaks, worn out fittings, and other plumbing problems will be fixed.</p>
<p>With all the home water purification systems - including salt-free residential water softeners - that are on the marketplace, how do you choose what is right for your home? Make sure to compare water softeners based upon your house's water and your household's water use. An authorized EcoWater Pro can detect your water and suggest the very best choice for your home.</p>
<p>The need for backflow preventers is obvious, but how do they work and which designs are best for certain applications? Typically the type and installation requirements are spelled out by local statutes and ecological policies. Local building regulations for instance will require a vertical separation of at least one inch to form an air gap in between a faucet opening and the greatest possible water level in its sink or basin. The resultant space breaks any potential siphon prior to it can take place, preventing polluting water from being sucked back into the pipe system. Other laws can require the installation of more complex and advanced backflow preventers. And the design of these mechanical gadgets installed to avoid backflow range from the reasonably basic to the complex and really sophisticated.</p>

<p>In time, the resin beads in the water softener will become covered with calcium and magnesium ions, lessening their capacity to soften tough water. Through a process called regeneration, water is automatically flushed through the water softener with a concentrated amount of regenerant. Now the resin beads get the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the firmness on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems include an entire house water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain. With the resin beads charged," the water softener returns to service, supplying the whole home with clean, soft water.</p>

Picture 3 shows how to set the slack just right.</p>
