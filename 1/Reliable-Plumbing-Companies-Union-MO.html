<p>An RPBA is a mechanical backflow preventer that consists of two separately acting, spring-loaded check valves with a hydraulically operating, mechanically independent, spring-loaded pressure differential relief valve in between the check valves and below the first check valve. It consists of shutoff valves at each end of the assembly and is geared up with test dicks. An RPBA is effective against backpressure backflow and backsiphonage and might be used to separate health or non-health risks.</p>
<p>During regular operation, the pressure in between the two check valves, described as the zone of reduced pressure, is preserved at a lower pressure than the supply pressure. The relief valve is created to open and release water to the exterior if either check valve ought to leak. An RPZ will periodically release small amounts of water due to fluctuation in line pressure up or downstream of the assembly. For this reason, the RPZ ought to be set up in areas that are not subject to water damage and allow sufficient drainage.</p>
