<p>I had a significant sewer issue with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I started calling any number I might discover on Google. I actually got their number for another company that could not come soon enough but referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to examine and give me a price quote. They right away cleared the preliminary clog, allowing for the renters to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon additional examination, there was a considerable blockage that needed excavation to investigate. His team was on website the extremely next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this initial problem and setting up a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a 3rd time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
