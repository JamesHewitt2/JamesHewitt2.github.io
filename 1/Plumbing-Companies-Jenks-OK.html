<p>Water softeners been available in all sizes and shapes and bigger definitely does not indicate much better. WaterBoss ® uses great mesh resin - smaller sized beads that in fact supply more area to soften water. This resin is vacuum-packed to enable optimal capability in a minimum of space. Plus, our trademarked Directional Circulation Screen system helps guarantee that no resin bead goes unused. Our screens and whole-house dirt and sediment filter likewise protect the resin bed, so we do not need to lose area on freeboard" which is the empty area in conventional water softeners that allow a churning of resin during regrowth to launch dirt, firmness and sediment.</p>
<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is just half the formula! To simply put some media inside a tank and hope for the best is common in our industry and lots of companies try to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Again, years of experience and comprehensive testing led us to design a tank that fluidizes the media bed much better than any other style on the market. Fluidization is the key to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media transforms the firmness in the water to calcite crystals which will not adhere to anything even under severe temperature levels. It's only with the media and the fluidization effectively working together that you can achieve this.</p>
