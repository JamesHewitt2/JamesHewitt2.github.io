<p>To figure out which toilet valve is triggering the problem, take a look at the overflow tube. If water is overflowing into the tube, there's a problem with the toilet fill valve. If the water level is listed below the top of television, the flush valve is leaking, allowing water to drip into the bowl. That sluggish, consistent outflow of water avoids the fill valve from closing completely. We removed the fronts and backs of brand-new toilets to show you how to replace these toilet tank parts. Your toilet and toilet tank parts won't look so pristine inside. You'll find scummy surface areas, water stains and deterioration. However don't be squeamish-- the water is as clean as the things that comes out of your faucets.</p>
