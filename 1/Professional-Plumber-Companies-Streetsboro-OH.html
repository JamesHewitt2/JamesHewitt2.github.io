<p>Figuring out if you need a water softener is an individual preference. A permit is not needed for repairs which involve just the working parts of a faucet or valve or clearance of interruptions provided modifications are not made in the existing piping or fixtures.

A small-diameter fill tube links the brine tank to the softener tank. And a discharge hose ranges from the softener tank to a close-by drain or drywell.</p>
