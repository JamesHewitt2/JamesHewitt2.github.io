<p>As the name recommends, a backflow preventer works to ensure that liquids do not recede versus the required direction of circulation. When utilized in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is used to ensure that water does not flow from the sprinkler system back into the community water supply, or other source of drinking water. Regrettably, water kept in the lawn sprinkler can become contaminated. There is potential for the infected water to end up being a health danger if permitted to re-enter the water supply. The backflow preventer is meant to avoid water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be checked regularly for efficiency, in addition to checked yearly by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
