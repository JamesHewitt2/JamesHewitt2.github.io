Dura PEX tends to have a great deal of oxidization. This triggers cracks in the tubing that can cause leaks. As these leaks take place, zinc is seeped from the fittings on the pipes, triggering them to weaken. Lastly, chlorinated water has been discovered to trigger cracks in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the best solution to all of these concerns.</p>
