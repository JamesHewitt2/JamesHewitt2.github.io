<p>I had a significant sewer concern with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was supporting into the basement shower. I began calling any number I might discover on Google. I actually received their number for another company that could not come quickly enough however referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to investigate and give me an estimate. They right away cleared the initial blockage, permitting the tenants to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon more examination, there was a considerable blockage that required excavation to investigate. His team was on website the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this initial problem and setting up a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a 3rd time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
