<p>Say you choose to go that route. The next question is whether you can install it yourself. Put it in this manner, if you're a knowledgeable helpful person, but you have actually never handled this particular repair, you can probably do it, offering you do your homework. I would fix a limit at attempting to install a power-vented gas-fired water heater (and some other specialized models). Their installation needs to be managed by a licensed mechanical or plumbing contractor.</p>

The specifics - where you begin, just how much you cut, and how it's all set up - are unique to each installation.
