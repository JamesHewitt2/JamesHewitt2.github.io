<p>Just recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line in between their brand-new home and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we utilized our sewer camera to examine the line and figure out the cause of the issue. The line was clearly deteriorating; some sections were just held together by the ground around them. Another clog loomed. Even even worse, the line could collapse requiring a significant repair or replacement.</p>
