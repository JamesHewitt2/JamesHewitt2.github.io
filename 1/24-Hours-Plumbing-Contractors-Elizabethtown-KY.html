<p>Water softeners work through a process called ion exchange which gets rid of calcium and magnesium from the water. When the tough water participates in the mineral tank, it streams through a bed of spherical resin beads These plastic beads, generally made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion. The resin beads are anions, implying they have a negative charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a favorable charge, making them cations. Since opposite charges bring in, the unfavorable charge of the minerals is brought in to the positive charge of the resin beads. As the difficult water passes through the resin, the beads grab ahold of the mineral ions and remove them from the water. When the bead seizes the mineral ion, the salt ion is released. The column of resin strips all the hardness out of the water as it passes through the mineral tank, and softened water flows out into your home.</p>
