Solder on any nipples and fittings before linking the system to the bypass valve to avoid melting the plastic if you are using copper pipes. Seal all threads with plumber's tape. Plastic tubing like PEX can likewise be used. Though it may need extra adapters, versatile tubing is far much easier to deal with and can use push-to-connect fittings, saving you time and the trouble of soldering.</p>
