<p>After getting here after their window, they started to investigate the kitchen sink (and after among the 2 gentlemen threw up outdoors), they ran a snake down the sink and after that put the sink back together however claimed they wouldn't take responsibility if it leaked now because of some undefined curiosity in how my sink was put together. After they provided me the "don't put grease down the sink" lecture and they left, I observed they handled to reassemble the sink in such a manner in which the sprayer hose was twisted around the plumbing.
