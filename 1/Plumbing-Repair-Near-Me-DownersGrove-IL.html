Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to reduce its mineral material.

Harder water will lead to more salt, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this boost in salt is minor, but if you've been recommended by a medical professional to follow a rigorous low sodium diet plan this boost can pose problems.</p>
