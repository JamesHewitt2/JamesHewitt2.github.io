<p>A variety of companies, such as the American Water Functions Association (AWWA) and the American Backflow Prevention Association (ABPA) use certification courses developed to train experts to check backflow preventers. Requirements for training differ by jurisdiction. Inspection of backflow preventers needs understanding of installation requirements, although inspectors are not required to become certified.</p>

The particles of calcium integrate, become heavier than the remainder of the water and sink to the bottom of the holding basins.

Versatile gas lines are typically more effective to inflexible lines, especially in locations where earthquakes are more common and for the connection in between the supply and appliance. Versatile gas lines are less likely to be disconnected in a natural catastrophe which decreases the danger of an explosion or fire.</p>
