<p>The ability of the system to treat water that is offered by your municipality. The water is dealt with but still contains hardness and appropriate contaminant levels according to managed standards. A set up backflow preventer (blue device, center) protects the general public water supply from contamination. Depending on the brand and design of your toilet, a new tank can cost about $34-$ 255 from your local home improvement shop to replace the old one.</p>

Backsiphonage is backflow brought on by a negative pressure (i.e., a vacuum or partial vacuum) in a public water supply or consumer's drinkable water supply.

<p>The Final Jeopardy answer, you ask? The device that regulates water flow in your toilet. If you look behind your toilet, you'll see a supply line that ranges from the outlet in the wall to the bottom of the toilet fill valve. This is how water enters into your toilet. After you flush the toilet, the fill valve opens to refill the water in the tank and the toilet bowl, readying the system for the next flush. If your fill valve is broken, not set at the correct level, or isn't set up properly, you might experience a regularly or continuously "running" toilet - which can cost you numerous dollars in wasted water.</p>
