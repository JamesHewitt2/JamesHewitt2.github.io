<h3>Leaky Faucets at GrandHaven MI - Renewing Valve Seats and Sealing Stems</h3>
<p>In water distribution systems, water is typically preserved at a significant pressure to allow water to flow from the tap, shower, or other fixture. Water pressure may stop working or be reduced when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is suddenly high need on the water system (for example, when numerous fire hydrants are opened).
