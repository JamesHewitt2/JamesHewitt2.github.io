While there's not a precise schedule as to when you must repipe your house, you ought to definitely check out repiping if they have not been done in 50 years or more-- specifically if you reside in an older home built closer to the turn of the last century.</p>
<p>Garbage disposals are an essential feature in any modern-day kitchen. If you reside in an older house, your sink may not have one, requiring you to be thorough about keeping food scraps from flowing down the drain.
