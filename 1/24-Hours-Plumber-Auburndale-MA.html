<p>All of the drains in your home, from your toilets, sinks, tubs, and showers all drain into one main drain under your home then leave into the sewer or septic system from your home. Then that typically suggests that your main sewer line is backing up when you experience blockages in multiple drains at once in your house. This can take place in numerous places and any combination of drains. For instance, water might fill in your bathtub when you run your washing machine. There are several combinations of this type of backup. The point is your drains all connect, and as soon as you have a backup in your main sewer line, you'll experience backup and overruning from multiple drain lines in your house.</p>
<p>When a flush valve triggers a toilet to run, a worn flapper is typically the offender. However not always. Initially, look at the chain that raises the flapper. It can tangle up and prevent the flapper from closing strongly if there's too much slack in the chain. A chain with too little slack can cause problem too. Image 3 demonstrates how to set the slack perfect.</p>
