<p>Wood pipes were utilized in London and in other places during the 17th and 16th centuries. The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a small hole in which the water would go through. 21 The several pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wood pipes were used in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wood tubes were extensively used in the USA during the 20th century. These pipes (utilized in place of corrugated iron or strengthened concrete pipes) were made from areas cut from brief lengths of wood. Locking of surrounding rings with wood dowel pins produced a flexible structure. About 100,000 feet of these wood pipes were set up throughout WW2 in drainage culverts, storm sewers and channels, under highways and at army camps, marine stations, airfields and ordnance plants.</p>
