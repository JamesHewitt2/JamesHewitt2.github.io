<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean supply of water pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature level boosts in boilers, and so on.
