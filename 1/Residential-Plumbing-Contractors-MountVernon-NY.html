<p>A water softener is a whole-house filtration system that eliminates hardness-causing calcium and magnesium minerals from your water through a process called ion exchange.  A water softener addresses one of the most widespread and devastating water problems: tough water.  Hard water damaged the modern-day home. Scale builds up in your pipes, blocking them and decreasing water pressure.  Scale drastically reduces the lifespan of devices like dishwashers, coffee makers and ice makers. Hard water ruins warm water devices. The higher the temperature of the water, the more calcium and magnesium will solidify and solidify into strong deposits inside your hot water heater.</p>

<p>Duty for installation falls upon the owner of the residential or commercial property or the co-op or condominium board. Owners and boards of buildings that are issued an order by the DEP to install a backflow preventer need to file strategies with the DEP within 1 month. If the DEP has actually not gotten certification from a PE, RA, or LMP that the backflow preventer is at least in the process of being installed within that time, a Notice of Violation will be sent out. Violators will be responsible for a civil penalty of up to $1,000 provided by the Environmental Control Board (ECB). Continued non-compliance can eventually cause criminal and civil actions and procedures, along with the termination of water service to the building.</p>
