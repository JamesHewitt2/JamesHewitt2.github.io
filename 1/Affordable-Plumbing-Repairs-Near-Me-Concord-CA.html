<p>106.2.2 Ten-Percent Guideline, General.

<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is just half the formula! To simply pour some media inside a tank and expect the very best is common in our industry and many companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Again, years of experience and thorough testing led us to design a tank that fluidizes the media bed better than any other style on the market. Fluidization is the essential to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media transforms the firmness in the water to calcite crystals which will not stick to anything even under severe temperatures. It's just with the media and the fluidization correctly working together that you can accomplish this.</p>
