<p>Another disadvantage of water softening through ion exchange is the potential health threat for people on low salt diets. Ion exchange increases the amount of salt in water, in order to lower its mineral material.

Harder water will lead to more salt, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this boost in salt is small, however if you have actually been recommended by a physician to follow a rigorous low salt diet this increase can posture problems.</p>
