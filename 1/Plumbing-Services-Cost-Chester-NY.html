<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is just half the equation! To simply put some media inside a tank and hope for the very best is common in our market and many companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Again, years of experience and thorough testing led us to design a tank that fluidizes the media bed much better than any other design on the marketplace. Fluidization is the crucial to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media transforms the solidity in the water to calcite crystals which will not stay with anything even under severe temperature levels. It's just with the media and the fluidization appropriately collaborating that you can attain this.</p>
