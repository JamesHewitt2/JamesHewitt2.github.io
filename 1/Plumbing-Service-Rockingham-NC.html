<p>Concealed water leaks are frequently demanding and have Possibly Major Repercussions. Replacing your flapper may need slightly various actions than we reveal (Images 2 and 3). Your flapper may screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. Discovering a replacement flapper might be the hardest part of the job if you have an uncommon flush valve. To discover an appropriate replacement, shut off the water, take the old one with you to the house center or hardware store. (Shut off the water before eliminating the flapper.) You may not find a similar match, however possibilities are you'll locate one of the very same shape and diameter. If not, try a plumbing supply store (in the Yellow Pages under Plumbing Supplies") or search online.</p>
<p>If you decide to try this job yourself, be prepared to keep careful track of about a lots tiny parts (put the stopper in the sink so none of them fall down the drain). There are many different faucet styles, so you might not have the ability to tell what to replace until you have actually done the disassembly. Whether you do it yourself or employ a plumber, this would be a good time to consider whether you want to upgrade the faucet with a brand-new style.</p>
