<p>To identify which toilet valve is triggering the problem, look at the overflow tube. If water is overruning into the tube, there's a problem with the toilet fill valve. If the water level is listed below the top of television, the flush valve is leaking, allowing water to trickle into the bowl. That slow, constant outflow of water avoids the fill valve from closing completely. We removed the fronts and backs of brand-new toilets to reveal you how to replace these toilet tank parts. Your toilet and toilet tank parts will not look so pristine inside. You'll discover scummy surface areas, water discolorations and corrosion.
