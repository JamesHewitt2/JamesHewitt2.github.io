Sewer pipes can be infamously hard to trace, especially on older residential or commercial properties, so you'll wish to hire somebody who will trace the issue at its root cause.</p>
<p>At least when every 3 months, drain water from the tank. Over time sediment builds at the bottom of the heater, which can hinder efficiency, and draining pipes a gallon or so helps eliminate the sediment. If you find a leak and go with a patching job instead of a repiping job, just bear in mind that all the pipes in your home are probably made from the same product and they may be next. To prevent even more, more-costly repairs (like water damage from burst pipes), you might want to think about repiping your whole home when you spot a leak.</p>
