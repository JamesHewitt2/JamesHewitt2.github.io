House owners can generally anticipate a cost point between $100 and $300, however obviously, this is simply a rough quote.

<p>The labor expenses for disposal installation are primarily time related.

<p>Eventually, nevertheless, the beads reach maximum capacity and can't draw in any more mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank must be restored, or, flushed clean. That's where the salt water tank comes in. An on-board computer calculates the quantity of water that flows through the softener. When it reaches the preprogrammed setting, regeneration automatically starts. For a three-bedroom house and family of four, regeneration usually happens every 12,000 gallons.</p>
