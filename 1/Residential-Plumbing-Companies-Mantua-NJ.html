<p>A partial reroute is basically a little scale repiping of one or more affected areas of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost reliable, it is possible to just desert the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, ceilings and attics. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have actually experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can accumulate in cost really rapidly. This is the main reason why we will suggest a complete repipe in specific communities, based upon our experience.</p>
<p>In some cases a clog can be caused due to accumulation and grease within the system. Snaking the drain will not fix the issue if this is the case. You might have to check out using a high pressure water system to get rid of the clog. This process is a bit more expensive and will cost anywhere from $400-$ 1000, depending upon the seriousness of the clog. There are 2 standard piping materials used by plumbing experts. PEX and copper both use numerous advantages and benefits such as getting rid of the metal taste from your water.</p>
