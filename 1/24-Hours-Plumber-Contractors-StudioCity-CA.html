PG&E frequently does this when plumbing in their gas meters.</p>

<p>The leak from a pipe fitting that costs less than a dollar can easily trigger countless dollars in water damage, interrupt your household for weeks, and throw your remodel method off schedule. So hiring a licensed, insured master plumber (or a well-trained apprentice working under his license) is a no-brainer. But not all plumbers manage all kinds of work. Their duties break out into 2 categories: Plumbers who handle fundamental repairs (often in emergency scenarios), and plumbers who specialize in redesigning jobs and additions.</p>
<p>Tom of Gotelli Plumbing provided superb service for us in changing a very balky tub spout, and worn toilet parts. Not just was he comprehensive and extremely professional however he was able to address all my questions concerning the service. If I could, I would give 6 stars.

<p>Frequent leaks: Leaks originating from your water heater are never ever an excellent indication. It is likely more economical to replace the whole system if your water heater has regular leaks or is constantly needing repairs. A backflow preventer is a device that's installed on your house's water pipes that allows water to flow in one instructions however never in the opposite direction. Its sole task is to avoid drinking water from being contaminated due to backflow.</p>
<p>If your hot water heater has required numerous repairs over the last couple of years, it may be time to get it replaced. A great rule of thumb for hot water heater is this: due to the fact that the life expectancy of the average hot water heater is in between 8-12 years, around 5-6 years is the halfway point. It makes more financial sense to replace your water heater if the cost of a repair is more than half the cost of a replacement at that point.</p>
