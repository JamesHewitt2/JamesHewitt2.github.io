<p>Our Water Softeners Are Brilliantly Created To Work. Buying a home is a big investment. Knowing if you have galvanized water pipes, copper drain pipes, lead closet bends, or an inferior piping system can be helpful when working out the sale of a home.

However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping comes in.

Steel was the most popular option for house plumbing for lots of decades, but steel ultimately experiences rust and lacks the sturdiness of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
