<p>The toilet takes a truly long time to flush. Here's how it works: During typical operation, the pressure in between the 2 check valves-- referred to as the zone of reduced pressure-- is preserved at a lower pressure than the supply pressure. If either check valve ought to leak, the relief valve is created to open and release water to the outside, making sure backflow never ever happens.</p>
