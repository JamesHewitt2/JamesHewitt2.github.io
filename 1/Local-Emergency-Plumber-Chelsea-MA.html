<p>The most effective way to address difficult water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are collected by small resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When difficult water comes in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and replaced with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>Check the status of your water heater's anode rod if you see rust just in your hot water. If you've never ever done this on your own, you might need a professional to do this.

On the other hand, if you see rust from both your hot and cold water taps, you probably have actually rusted piping.</p>
