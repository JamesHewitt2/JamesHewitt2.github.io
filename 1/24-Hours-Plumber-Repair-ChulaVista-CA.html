<p>It may be time to get it replaced if your water heater has actually required multiple repairs over the last few years. A great general rule for hot water heater is this: due to the fact that the life expectancy of the typical hot water heater is between 8-12 years, around 5-6 years is the halfway point. It makes more monetary sense to replace your water heater if the cost of a repair is more than half the cost of a replacement at that point.</p>
<p>Some of the causes of drain line clogs in kitchen drains are years of drain build-up, a stopping working waste disposal unit, or too much food being gotten rid of down the drain. We will generally recommend our PowerSnake or ZOOM Jetting ® services, depending on the intensity of the circumstance. Offer us a call if your kitchen drain has raised water levels, is making gurgling noises, smells foul, or is sluggish to drain.</p>
