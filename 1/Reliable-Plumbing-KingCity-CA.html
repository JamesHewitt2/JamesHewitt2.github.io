<p>Set out the new disposal and parts in preparation for installation. I've been to lots of carwashes that have a softener, and to the surprise of the owners, the water tests hard even after having actually gone through the softener. Generally, this is since the system is dated or not working effectively. Whatever the factor, you can be losing out on the advantages of soft water without even knowing it.</p>

<p>Responsive circulation technology works by continually bringing tanks online and off-line in response to the water demands of your carwash. For example, in a four-tank MTS setup with responsive circulation technology, just one of the four tanks is needed to soften water when the carwash isn't busy. However, more tanks come on-line as the wash bays fill up. This responsive style enables the MTS to consume to 50% less salt and 38% less regrowth water than standard single-tank or twin rotating systems.</p>

<h3>Experts In Plumbing, Heating, Cooling & Electrical Services KingCity CA</h3>
<p>Marin WATER is a professional plumbing and water treatment expert located in San Rafael, CA. We happily serve commercial and residential customers throughout Marin County, California. Does your water taste bad? Does it leave a chalky residue on your fixtures and counters? No matter what problems you're having with your tap water, RainSoft has the perfect option.</p>
<p>Water softeners resolve a procedure called ion exchange which gets rid of calcium and magnesium from the water. When the hard water participates in the mineral tank, it streams through a bed of spherical resin beads These plastic beads, normally made from polystyrene, are charged with a salt ion. The resin beads are anions, indicating they have an unfavorable charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a positive charge, making them cations. Because opposite charges bring in, the unfavorable charge of the minerals is attracted to the favorable charge of the resin beads. As the hard water travels through the resin, the beads get ahold of the mineral ions and remove them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the salt ion is launched. The column of resin strips all the hardness out of the water as it travels through the mineral tank, and softened water flows out into your house.</p>
