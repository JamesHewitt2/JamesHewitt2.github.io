<p>Woodbury, along with numerous other communities and companies, has found the very best way to avoid these discolorations from taking place is by minimizing the number of times your water softener regrows. "Regrowing" refers to the way softeners clean all the calcium and magnesium mineral deposits out of the filter medium when it becomes "tired" or complete. However, numerous water softeners regrow frequently, when the filter medium actually isn't complete. This can be remedied by simply resetting your water softener to get rid of less solidity or to run longer in between regeneration cycles.</p>
