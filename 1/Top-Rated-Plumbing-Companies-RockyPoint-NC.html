<p>Home water softeners, also called ion exchange systems, are appliances that remove calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for sodium or potassium.

<p>Pre-action sprinkler systems usually are installed in areas where water could trigger devastating damage, such as in freezers, computer rooms, and areas with electronic devices. The piping in a pre-action system contains air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized. Water to the system is kept back by the pre-action valve, which is connected to a fire detection system. If a fire occurs, the detection system sends a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then enables water into the system's piping. The water is discharged through the open sprinkler.</p>

<p>Examples of backflow conditions include backsiphonage and back pressure. Early diagnosis and repair can conserve your plumbing system from unnecessary obstructions even more down the water lines.

<p>Nevertheless, UPC design code requires stand-alone residential systems using non-potable piping materials to achieve the very same level of protection as a commercial system. When chemicals are included to a fire protection system provided by a drinkable water supply, increased defense is likewise required. If you have kids, remind them to prevent hanging on any visible pipelines or having fun with the outdoor gas meter. Hanging on a pipeline may trigger it to come loose or break, launching gas into the house. The outdoor gas meter must be kept clear of any debris, such as plants or snow, so it is easily available in an emergency.</p>
