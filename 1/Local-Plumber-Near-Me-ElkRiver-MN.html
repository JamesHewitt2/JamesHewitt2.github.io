<p>Rust is an intricate phenomenon and there are numerous factors that speed up deterioration in the drinking-water circulation system and premise plumbing. For many years, there has actually been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and corrosion, making it essential to compare naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is destructive as it has a low pH and low TDS; nevertheless, cation -exchange water softening does not contribute to any elements that speed up deterioration Also, there is a lack of clinical evidence supporting the claim that hard-water scale is an efficient form of rust control. Hence, considering all these aspects, along with results from research studies, WQA's position is that an effectively set up cation -exchange water softener does not make water more destructive.</p>
