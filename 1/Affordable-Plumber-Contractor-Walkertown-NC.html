It had to be hauled by a truck and included a 10 hp gas engine and 1000 feet of steel cable television. It can cleaning big commercial and municipal sewer pipes. An improved variation called "The Mainliner" was presented in 1958 that might also thread telephone cable. It was discontinued in 1973.</p>
