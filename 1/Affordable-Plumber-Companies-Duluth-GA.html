<p>Corrosion is a complicated phenomenon and there are many aspects that accelerate rust in the drinking-water circulation system and facility plumbing. For years, there has actually been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and deterioration, making it essential to compare naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is corrosive as it has a low pH and low TDS; however, cation -exchange water softening does not contribute to any aspects that speed up deterioration Also, there is an absence of scientific proof supporting the claim that hard-water scale is an effective kind of deterioration control.
