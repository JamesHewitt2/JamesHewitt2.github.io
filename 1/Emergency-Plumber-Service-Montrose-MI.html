<p>Another method to deal with a clog is by using a chemical cleaning product or if you fear they might be too extreme on your pipes, you can try old natural home remedy like warm water, vinegar, and baking soda. Call Plumb Perfect Plumbing and ask about our clogged toilet repair service if you've tried whatever and the clog remains. With copper water piping your water will be cleaner and flow quicker.

<p>Renovation plumbers typically charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one guy and a truck. Again, this does not include the cost of parts. However increasingly more plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their bids are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly invest a lot more. With this method, you understand the turnkey price entering into the task, and any surprises are the plumber's duty, not yours.</p>
