That odor may be originating from your sewer system, which requires repair immediately. If your vent stack, the part of your plumbing system that gets rid of sewage from your home, releases sewer gas, and regulates atmospheric pressure in the waste-system pipes has stopped working, it will often need to be replaced rather than repaired. You'll know this if your pipes are gurgling or giving off foul odors.</p>
<p>Foul Sewer Smell: Among the very first most apparent signs of a sewer problem is a smell of sewage when you flush the toilet, or in the backyard (in the area where your sewer line would be).

Even if the problem originates with the local system, it's still smart to bring in the experts to limit the damage to your house.</p>

Identifying and repairing a leak can avoid damage and expensive repairs. You might find that your water pipes are leaking or you have low water pressure if you have old piping in your home.
