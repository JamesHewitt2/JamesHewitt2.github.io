<p>Figuring out if you need a water softener is a personal choice. A license is not required for repairs which involve only the working parts of a faucet or valve or clearance of stoppages provided modifications are not made in the existing piping or components. A normal water softener includes a high, narrow water-softener tank, and a brief, broad salt water tank. The softener tank is connected to the house's water-supply line. A small-diameter fill tube connects the brine tank to the softener tank. And a discharge hose ranges from the softener tank to a neighboring drain or drywell.</p>
<p>Since of negative or reduced pressure in the supply side of the water system, back siphonage occurs when water is drawn or pulled backwards. Infected water can be pulled into the supply line from sprinklers or other emitters if the irrigation line does not have a backflow preventer at the cross-connection. If your sewer lines are having issues in the Denver area, contact Rooter66 Plumbing & Drain Cleaning at 303-596-0265. Our licensed plumbers are fully trained and experienced in sewer repairs for your home or business.</p>
