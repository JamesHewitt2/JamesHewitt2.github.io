<h3>Golden Rules To Follow In Plumbing Emergencies Trinity NC</h3>
<p>If a cable has not yet been run to the junction box, you can make the connections within the new disposer any time in advance, joining the cable television to the wires in package just before or just after installing the disposer. Garbage disposals are pretty easy to maintain. The most essential thing to bear in mind is that they are actually food disposals. Products that would otherwise go in the garbage should not be placed in your disposal. This includes glass, plastic, metals (yes, silverware), paper, anything flammable, bleach, drain cleaners, and toys.</p>
<p>You should never ever put metal, glass, or plastic down your disposal. In a lot of cases we find silverware jammed in the disposal and it can be damaging to your system.
