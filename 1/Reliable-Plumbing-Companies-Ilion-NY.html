<p>The majority of homes or structures that were built in the 1970s usually have galvanized piping. In time, the plumbing system can break and the pipes can begin to wear away. This can trigger low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to offer weather condition security. As the outer coating of zinc begins to erode, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, triggering the iron to ultimately rust.</p>

In some cases it might be necessary to filter the water before it gets to your softener to avoid fouling. If the resin becomes fouled, commercial cleaners are readily available. Cleaners need to be used according to producer guidelines to avoid contamination.</p>
