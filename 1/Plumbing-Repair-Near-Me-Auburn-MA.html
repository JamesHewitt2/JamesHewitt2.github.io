<h3>Plumber Installation & Repair Service Auburn MA</h3>
<p>The leak from a pipe fitting that costs less than a dollar can quickly cause thousands of dollars in water damage, disrupt your household for weeks, and toss your remodel method off schedule. So employing a licensed, insured master plumber (or a well-trained apprentice working under his license) is a no-brainer. But not all plumbers manage all kinds of work. Their duties break out into two categories: Plumbers who handle basic repairs (often in emergency circumstances), and plumbers who specialize in remodeling additions and jobs.</p>
<p>Tom of Gotelli Plumbing offered superb service for us in changing an extremely balky tub spout, and worn out toilet parts. Not just was he comprehensive and exceptionally professional but he was able to address all my questions concerning the service. If I could, I would offer 6 stars. A video camera inspection of your sewer line is one of the most effective methods of finding the precise location of a plumbing problem.
