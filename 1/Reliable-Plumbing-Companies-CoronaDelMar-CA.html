<p>In water distribution systems, water is usually maintained at a substantial pressure to enable water to stream from the tap, shower, or other fixture. Water pressure may fail or be decreased when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is unexpectedly high demand on the water system (for example, when numerous fire hydrants are opened). Minimized pressure in the pipe may enable polluted water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be prepared into the system.</p>
<p>Wood pipes were utilized in London and somewhere else throughout the 17th and 16th centuries. The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a small hole in which the water would pass through. 21 The several pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wood pipes were used in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wood tubes were extensively used in the USA throughout the 20th century. These pipes (used in place of corrugated iron or reinforced concrete pipes) were made from areas cut from brief lengths of wood. Locking of nearby rings with hardwood dowel pins produced a flexible structure. About 100,000 feet of these wood pipes were set up during WW2 in drainage culverts, storm drains and conduits, under highways and at army camps, marine stations, airfields and ordnance plants.</p>

Broken Pipes: Pipes are cracked, punctured or collapsed by moving soil, frozen ground, settling, etc</p>
