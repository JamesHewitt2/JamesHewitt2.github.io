<h3>Top Rated Atlanta Plumber Blanchester OH</h3>
<p>PEX pipes were thought to be a better alternative to polybutylene and galvanized piping. Sadly, one brand name is experiencing a lot of problems: Dura PEX. Dura PEX tends to have a great deal of oxidization. This triggers cracks in the tubing that can lead to leakages. As these leaks happen, zinc is seeped from the fittings on the pipes, causing them to weaken. Lastly, chlorinated water has actually been found to trigger cracks in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the very best option to all of these problems.</p>
