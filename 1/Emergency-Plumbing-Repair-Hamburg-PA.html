<p>Hidden water leakages are frequently difficult and have Possibly Serious Consequences. Replacing your flapper might need somewhat various actions than we show (Photos 2 and 3). Your flapper may screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. Finding a replacement flapper might be the hardest part of the task if you have an uncommon flush valve. To find a suitable replacement, shut off the water, take the old one with you to the house center or hardware store. (Switch off the water before eliminating the flapper.) You might not find an identical match, but possibilities are you'll locate one of the very same shape and size. If not, try a plumbing supply store (in the Yellow Pages under Plumbing Materials") or search online.</p>
