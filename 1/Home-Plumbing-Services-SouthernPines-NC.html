However, if there are a number of leakages within the system, or if there is evidence of corrosion in a number of places, it is most likely time to repipe.

Difficult water with calcium and magnesium streams through this resin and, in a process called ion exchange, the solidity ions in the water trade places with soft ions on the resin beads.
