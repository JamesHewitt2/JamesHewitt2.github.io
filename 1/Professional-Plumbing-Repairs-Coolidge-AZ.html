That sluggish, consistent outflow of water prevents the fill valve from closing entirely. We removed the fronts and backs of brand-new toilets to show you how to replace these toilet tank parts. Your toilet and toilet tank parts will not look so pristine inside. You'll discover scummy surfaces, water discolorations and deterioration.
