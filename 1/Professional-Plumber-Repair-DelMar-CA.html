Backflow into a public water supply can contaminate or contaminate the water in that system (i.e., backflow into a public water supply can make the water in that system hazardous or unusable to drink), and each water supplier has an obligation to supply water that is functional and safe to consume under all foreseeable situations. Furthermore, customers generally have absolute faith that water provided to them through a public water supply is constantly safe to drink. For these reasons, your water district should take precautions to protect its public water supply versus backflow.</p>
