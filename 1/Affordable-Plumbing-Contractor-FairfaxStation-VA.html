<h3>Fix a Leaky Outside Frost Free Faucet in FairfaxStation VA</h3>

<p>After getting here after their window, they began to investigate the kitchen sink (and after among the two gentlemen tossed up outside), they ran a snake down the sink and after that put the sink back together but declared they wouldn't take duty if it dripped now due to the fact that of some undefined oddities in how my sink was assembled. After they offered me the "don't put grease down the sink" lecture and they left, I observed they managed to reassemble the sink in such a way that the sprayer hose was twisted around the plumbing. I didn't even bother to try calling them back, considering that I never want to see this company again.</p>
