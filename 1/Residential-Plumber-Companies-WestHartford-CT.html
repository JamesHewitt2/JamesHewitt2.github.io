<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean water supply pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a mix of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature level boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in potable water supply pressure happen whenever the amount of water being utilized goes beyond the quantity of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
