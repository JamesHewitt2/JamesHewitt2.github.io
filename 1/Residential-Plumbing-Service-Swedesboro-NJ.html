<p>As the name suggests, a backflow preventer works to guarantee that liquids do not recede versus the needed direction of circulation. When used in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is used to make sure that water does not flow from the lawn sprinkler back into the municipal water system, or other source of drinking water. Sadly, water held in the sprinkler system can end up being polluted. If enabled to return to the supply of water, there is potential for the polluted water to end up being a health risk. The backflow preventer is planned to avoid water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be examined frequently for effectiveness, as well as examined each year by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
