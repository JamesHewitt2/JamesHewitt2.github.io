<p>Domestic water that shows up to your Ohio house carries minerals that can cause rust on metal parts and elements. To prevent corrosion from rust, storage tanks are geared up with a bar made with magnesium called an anode rod. The rod safeguards the tank by attracting damaging products. By having the anode rod examined regularly and replaced as needed, you can double the life of your water heater.</p>
<p>Wooden pipes were utilized in London and somewhere else throughout the 17th and 16th centuries. The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a little hole in which the water would pass through. 21 The numerous pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wood pipes were used in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wood tubes were extensively utilized in the USA throughout the 20th century. These pipes (utilized in place of corrugated iron or reinforced concrete pipes) were made of areas cut from brief lengths of wood. Locking of adjacent rings with wood dowel pins produced a versatile structure. About 100,000 feet of these wood pipes were installed during WW2 in drainage culverts, storm sewers and avenues, under highways and at army camps, naval stations, airfields and ordnance plants.</p>
