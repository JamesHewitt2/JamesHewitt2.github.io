<p>IRWD is dedicated to providing safe, high quality water to clients. Our comprehensive water quality program operates 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, to guarantee that the water delivered to our consumers is kept devoid of damaging impurities. A fundamental part of our water quality program is the backflow prevention program When a water line is connected to equipment containing a nonpotable substance, this is referred to as a cross-connection. Contamination may take place when water streams through a cross-connection from a nonpotable source, such as a lawn sprinkler or heating & cooling system, into the potable water supply. This can occur through a process called backflow.</p>
<p>Some states need steamfitters and pipefitters to be licensed; they may also require a special license to deal with gas lines. Licensing typically needs an exam or work experience or both.
