<p>Hidden water leaks are frequently stressful and have Possibly Serious Consequences. Replacing your flapper might need somewhat different steps than we reveal (Pictures 2 and 3).

In some designs, test dicks can be used to get rid of air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in an area where the air will accumulate.</p>
