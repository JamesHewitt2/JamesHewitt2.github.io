<p>We specialize in tub and shower replacement and full bathroom renovating at extremely competitive pricing. Switch on the gas and examine connections for leakages by brushing a 50-50 mix of dishwashing liquid and water over the joints. If the mix bubbles, you have a leak.

And who wants to do all that work??? In all seriousness though, ensuring your trip lever is working well can conserve you the trouble of those small daily troubles - that many people just live with and never recognize they can fix in about 5 minutes - not to discuss the gallons of water wasted every day by a poor seal.</p>
