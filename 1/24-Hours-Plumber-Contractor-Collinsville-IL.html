Some disposer units do not featured a power cord attached. Eliminate the plate with a screwdriver to access the electrical wiring (Image 1) if this is the case. Make sure to buy an electrical wiring package with the appropriate power score and hardware for your disposer unit (Images 2 and 3). When you link the electrical wiring harness to the disposer, ensure the cable is long enough to reach the receptacle without stretching the cable.</p>
<p>Measure, cut, and link the pipes. Prior to connecting any pipes to your water softener, measure and cut your pipes to fit. Solder on any nipples and fittings prior to linking the unit to the bypass valve to avoid melting the plastic if you are using copper pipes. Seal all threads with plumber's tape. Plastic tubing like PEX can also be utilized. Though it might need additional adapters, flexible tubing is far much easier to work with and can use push-to-connect fittings, saving you time and the inconvenience of soldering.</p>
