<p>From showers and tubs clogged with hair and soap accumulation to sinks filled with tooth paste and other grime, restrooms provide many challenges when it concerns keeping drains complimentary and clear. Even toilets can be overwhelmed with bathroom tissue or non-flushable products. Regardless of the challenge, Roto-Rooter plumbers have all the equipment necessary to deal with clogged bathroom drains and can offer skilled sewer cleaning and drain cleaning services.</p>

You'll also find a drain valve near the tank bottom, and a control unit outside for setting temperatures and managing the pilot-light valve.</p>
