<p>New England Pipe Restoration is the premier sewer repair company in the Northeast. While this may appear like an issue with your faucet, it's normally caused by something else - like a plumbing issue or problem with your water heater. Increasingly more people are selling their old water heaters for brand-new, tankless variations. Whether you're wanting to increase your home's eco-friendliness or simply plain tired of lacking hot water, a tankless water heater could be the ideal solution for you.</p>
<p>New designs of garbage disposals may need to be hard-wired into a dedicated electrical circuit from the electrical panel; if this isn't offered in an older home, hiring an electrical expert to add a circuit costs around $150-$ 250. The drain line is clogged: If your kitchen sink blockages, never utilize chemical drain cleaner! Rather, call a plumber to locate and clear the clog without harming your garbage disposal.</p>

<p>A backflow preventer stops water inside your water pipes from flowing back to the City system if pressure is lost. Backflow can contaminate the water supply.
