After we have actually cleaned up the body, and the repaired components are still out of the body, and we have finished all of our part replacement and cleaning, we need to open the inlet turned off to flush any rust or particles. This can be challenging, specifically when the backflow prevention assembly is installed inside an area where water can not be splashed around.
