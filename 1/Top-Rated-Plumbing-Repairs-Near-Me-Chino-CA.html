<h3>Residential 24 Hour Emergency Plumber Near Me Chino CA</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to effectively get used to your business' flow rates throughout the day. During durations of high circulation demand, tanks come online to add circulation rate capability. During periods of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This new technique to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation technology, and it's arguably the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
