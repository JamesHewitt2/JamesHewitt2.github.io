<p>Hidden water leaks are often demanding and have Possibly Severe Effects. Changing your flapper might require slightly various steps than we reveal (Photos 2 and 3). Your flapper may screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. Finding a replacement flapper might be the hardest part of the job if you have an uncommon flush valve. To find an appropriate replacement, turn off the water, take the old one with you to the home center or hardware store. (Shut off the water prior to eliminating the flapper.) You might not find a similar match, but chances are you'll find one of the same shape and size. If not, attempt a plumbing supply shop (in the Telephone Directory under Plumbing Supplies") or search online.</p>
