<p>SofTap's water softening innovation is well-suited for household, commercial, and commercial applications, including the prevention of limescale build-up in households and scaling in commercial water treatment systems, as well as improving existing reverse osmosis treatment systems. The innovation is simpler and more affordable than other softening systems on the market today that use zeolites, which must be restored using salt water, or membrane nanofiltration that requires significant water use and high pressure.</p>
<p>Water firmness is the quantity of liquified calcium and magnesium in the water-- hard water is high in both calcium and magnesium. The factor you can feel the difference on your skin is since soap responds with the calcium to form soap scum. This results in the need for more soap or detergent to get things clean. And that's where the term solidity" came from ... it's hard to wash in.</p>
