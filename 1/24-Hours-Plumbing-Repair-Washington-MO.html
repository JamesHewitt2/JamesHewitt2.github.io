<p>There's no part of your house that has more of a direct impact on your safety, benefit, comfort, and reliability than your plumbing system. This is incredibly crucial! When you have cast iron drain lines you need 3-5 gallons of water that an older toilet offers to press the waste out of your drain system. Present guidelines restrict the amount of water a toilet can utilize per flush to 1.28 gallons per flush which can leave particles accumulating in cast iron drain lines. We provide two kinds of water treatment systems for tough water: Benefit Series Seawater Softeners and NaturSoft ® Water Softener Alternatives.</p>
<p>New designs of waste disposal unit may need to be hard-wired into a dedicated electrical circuit from the electrical panel; if this isn't offered in an older house, employing an electrician to add a circuit expenses around $150-$ 250.
