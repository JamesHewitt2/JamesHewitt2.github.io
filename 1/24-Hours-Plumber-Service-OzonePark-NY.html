<p>If you're buying a new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge majority of toilets, the drain is focused about 12 in. from the wall. However with a couple of designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To inspect the rough-in, simply measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in.. Many house centers bring only one or two 10-in. designs and no 14-in. designs. If you have to special-order a toilet, be prepared to spend a lot more.
