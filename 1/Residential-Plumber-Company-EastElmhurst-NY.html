<p>Backflow means the unfavorable turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the drinkable water supply; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from happening. Points at which a potable water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, but they need to be thoroughly designed and set up to avoid backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>
