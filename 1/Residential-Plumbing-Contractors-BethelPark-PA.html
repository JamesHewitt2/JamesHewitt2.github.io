<p>Aside from these two essential components, there are a myriad of little, perhaps less critical things that can break or degrade. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will corrode a lot more rapidly. Consistent gross smells originating from the toilet can indicate you need a new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising correctly, you might need a brand-new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can trigger a leak and burst. If mishandled, tank covers can crack and leave your toilet's inner operations exposed. While this won't affect the function of your toilet, it certainly does not do much for the visual of your bathroom.
