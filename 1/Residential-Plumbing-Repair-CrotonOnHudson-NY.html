This is an option to consider if you live in an older home - such as one built pre-1970 - or any home with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular option for home plumbing for lots of years, however steel eventually suffers from rust and lacks the resilience these days's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
