Please note that Roto-Rooter does not clean roofing rain gutters or rectangular aluminum seamless gutter downspouts.</p>

<h3>Water Heater Repair: When to Do It Yourself, and When to Call the Pros in Amityville NY</h3>
<p>When it concerns gas line installation and repair, it can be a dangerous task. Trying to install a gas line by yourself can result in electrocution, fire, or electrical circuitry issues. That's why it's vital to have a trained gas installation technician who understands what's he's doing. When you pick Pinky's plumbing for your gas installation needs, you can feel confident that our professionals have undergone a rigorous hands on training program and will have the knowledge and know-how to install or repair your gas system in a effective and timely way.</p>
<p>If you're buying a new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge majority of toilets, the waste pipe is centered about 12 in. from the wall. However with a couple of designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, simply measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't around 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. Many home centers bring just one or more 10-in. designs and no 14-in. models. Be prepared to invest much more if you have to special-order a toilet. If there's a door near the toilet, also determine how far the bowl extends from the wall. If you are changing a toilet with a standard bowl with an elongated" model, the door might not close. Read on to find out how to install a toilet.</p>
<p>Often you know you have a sewer line break since you can smell foul smells or you have a sewage back-up in your home. It is very important to identify the precise area of the break in your sewer line. Many times the break can be on the city side of the sewer line and understanding this can save you thousands of dollars in repairs. Just sharing a copy of your sewer line video with the city inspector can solve the problem. The technicians and plumbers at Jim Dandy Sewer and Plumbing can make a copy of your sewer scope video on a thumb drive so that you constantly have a copy for your insurance city, real estate agent or company inspector.</p>
<p>I can't state enough advantages about this company. Had a sewer repair required and had a really brief amount of time due to closing on a house sale. Each and every single individual I came across from Marquita doing logistics for my job to every member of the work team. Friendly, communicated well, absolutely responsive and actually cared to help me through this really stressful job. All of the people I came across were good example for what a well run service company need to be. Much thanks and gratitude. You're fantastic.</p>
