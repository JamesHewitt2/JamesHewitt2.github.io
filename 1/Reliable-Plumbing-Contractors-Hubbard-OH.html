<p>Deterioration is an intricate phenomenon and there are numerous factors that speed up deterioration in the drinking-water circulation system and premise plumbing. For years, there has been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and rust, making it important to distinguish between naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is destructive as it has a low pH and low TDS; however, cation -exchange water softening does not add to any aspects that speed up corrosion Likewise, there is a lack of scientific evidence supporting the claim that hard-water scale is a reliable type of rust control. Thus, considering all these elements, in addition to results from research studies, WQA's position is that an effectively configured cation -exchange water softener does not make water more destructive.</p>
