<p>The High Voltage Leak Detection Technology (HVLD) testing procedure includes a set of electrode probes which scans a sealed container made from a non-conductive material. Some disposer systems do not featured a power cord attached. If this holds true, eliminate the plate with a screwdriver to access the electrical wiring (Image 1). Make sure to buy an electrical wiring kit with the correct power rating and hardware for your disposer unit (Images 2 and 3). When you connect the wiring harness to the disposer, make sure the cable is long enough to reach the receptacle without extending the cable.</p>
