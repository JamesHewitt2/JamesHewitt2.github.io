<p>Rust is a complicated phenomenon and there are numerous aspects that accelerate deterioration in the drinking-water circulation system and property plumbing. For many years, there has been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and rust, making it important to distinguish between naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is destructive as it has a low pH and low TDS; however, cation -exchange water softening does not contribute to any aspects that accelerate corrosion Likewise, there is a lack of clinical evidence supporting the claim that hard-water scale is an efficient type of corrosion control. Hence, considering all these factors, as well as results from research study studies, WQA's position is that an effectively set up cation -exchange water softener does not make water more destructive.</p>

<p>Hot water heater repair and hot water heater installation are frequently postponed as long as possible. A hot water heater is a pricey plumbing device, and we tend to press off replacing it up until it breaks beyond repair. It is also a piece of plumbing equipment that we ignore until we awaken to a cold shower. We may hear the water heater making sounds, trying to inform us there is a problem, but we disregard it which might cause a more comprehensive repair that if we would have nipped it in the bud. It's important to get out in front of any problems as fast as possible. The quicker you respond to an issue, the better opportunity you'll need to save time and money on water heater services.</p>
