<p>You also need to invest in a backflow valve if you see your water has an uncommon flow, color, smell or taste. A plumbing professional can identify whether the problem with your faucet is a quick fix or the result of other concerns in your home's plumbing system. More complex concerns with water temperature or pressure may require changing the hot water heater, which generally costs $350-$ 3,500, depending upon capacity and type.</p>

<p>DCVs are particularly developed to avoid backflow in fire sprinkler systems. The essential for typical fire security applications, DCVs include an inlet (upstream) shutoff valve, two separately operating spring-loaded check valves (typically inside a single valve body), four test dicks, and an outlet (downstream) shutoff valve. Light-duty commercial-grade garbage disposals begin around $500-$ 2,500 and increase depending upon size, brand and features.</p>
<p>Electric water heaters have a much shorter lifespan than gas water heaters of comparable quality and capacity. Still, the distinction is not enough to make any considerable changes in the savings a gas heater will bring. Where a gas heater might last 8-15 years, the electric choice will last about 8-12 years.
