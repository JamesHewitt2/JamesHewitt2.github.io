<p>You also need to invest in a backflow valve if you see your water has an uncommon flow, color, smell or taste. A plumbing professional can identify whether the problem with your faucet is a quick fix or the result of other concerns in your home's plumbing system. More complex concerns with water temperature or pressure may require changing the hot water heater, which generally costs $350-$ 3,500, depending upon capacity and type.</p>
