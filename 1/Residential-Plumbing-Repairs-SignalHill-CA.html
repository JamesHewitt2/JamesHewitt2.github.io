<p>Pre-action sprinkler systems generally are installed in areas where water might trigger disastrous damage, such as in freezers, computer system rooms, and locations with electronic equipment. The piping in a pre-action system consists of air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized. Water to the system is held back by the pre-action valve, which is linked to a fire detection system. If a fire occurs, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then allows water into the system's piping. The water is discharged through the open sprinkler.</p>

The energy effectiveness of a storage hot water heater is suggested by its Energy Factor (EF). The more effective the water heater the higher the EF rating.
