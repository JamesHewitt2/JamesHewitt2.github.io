<p>Water softeners work through a procedure called ion exchange which eliminates calcium and magnesium from the water. When the tough water enters into the mineral tank, it streams through a bed of spherical resin beads These plastic beads, generally made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion. The resin beads are anions, suggesting they have a negative charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a favorable charge, making them cations. Since opposite charges bring in, the unfavorable charge of the minerals is attracted to the positive charge of the resin beads. As the tough water travels through the resin, the beads grab ahold of the mineral ions and remove them from the water. When the bead seizes the mineral ion, the sodium ion is released. The column of resin strips all the hardness out of the water as it travels through the mineral tank, and softened water flows out into your house.</p>
