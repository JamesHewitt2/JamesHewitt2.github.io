<p>Wood pipes were used in London and in other places throughout the 16th and 17th centuries. The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a little hole in which the water would pass through. 21 The several pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wood pipes were utilized in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wooden tubes were commonly used in the U.S.A. throughout the 20th century. These pipes (utilized in location of corrugated iron or reinforced concrete pipes) were made from sections cut from short lengths of wood. Locking of surrounding rings with wood dowel pins produced a flexible structure. About 100,000 feet of these wooden pipes were set up during WW2 in drainage culverts, storm sewers and channels, under highways and at army camps, naval stations, airfields and ordnance plants.</p>
