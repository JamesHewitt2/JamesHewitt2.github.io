<p>Among the most severe water heater problems is leaking water, which is often caused by defective temperature level and pressure (T&P) relief valves. If the leak is triggered by rust in the water tank, however, you'll likely need to replace the hot water heater. On this page are different Hyperlinks to help you in working with the City of Buffalo's Department of Permit and Inspection Services.</p>
<p>Softeners primarily eliminate calcium (Ca2+) and magnesium (Mg2+) ions. Calcium and magnesium are frequently described as 'solidity minerals'. In addition, if your pipes are rattling, clanging, clacking and making more noise than they should be (more than water flowing through the pipes), that's a big red flag that something more major is incorrect with them.</p>
