If the water level is listed below the top of the tube, the flush valve is leaking, enabling water to drip into the bowl. That sluggish, constant outflow of water prevents the fill valve from closing entirely. We removed the fronts and backs of brand-new toilets to reveal you how to replace these toilet tank parts. Your toilet and toilet tank parts won't look so pristine inside. You'll discover scummy surface areas, water spots and rust.
