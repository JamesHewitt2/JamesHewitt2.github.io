<p>A partial reroute is basically a small scale repiping of one or more afflicted locations of the plumbing underneath the slab.

Costing less than a full repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can build up in cost extremely quickly. This is the main reason why we will suggest a complete repipe in particular areas, based on our experience.</p>
