<p>I had a significant sewer issue with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I started calling any number I could discover on Google. I actually received their number for another company that couldn't come soon enough but referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and offer me a price quote. They immediately cleared the preliminary obstruction, permitting the tenants to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon further investigation, there was a considerable blockage that required excavation to examine. His team was on website the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this preliminary issue and installing a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a 3rd time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
