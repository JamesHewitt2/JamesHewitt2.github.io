<h3>Licensed Plumbing & HVAC Company In Wimberley TX</h3>
<p>The most effective method to deal with tough water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the solidity ions-- are collected by tiny resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When tough water is available in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and replaced with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>Backpressure backflow is brought on by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable water system pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable water system pressure, or a mix of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Decreases in safe and clean water supply pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being used surpasses the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
