<p>With tankless electrical heaters, water is heated up directly whenever it's needed. When the tap is changed on, tankless systems particularly make usage of an element that heats up water. The water is continuously heated up as long as the tap remains on. If the tap is immediately turned off, the water stops being heated up. The heating temperature is typically pre-set to fit your needs and choices.
