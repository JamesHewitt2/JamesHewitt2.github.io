<p>I had a major sewer issue with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I began calling any number I might find on Google. I in fact got their number for another company that could not come quickly enough but referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to examine and offer me an estimate. They instantly cleared the preliminary blockage, allowing for the tenants to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon additional examination, there was a considerable blockage that needed excavation to investigate. His team was on site the extremely next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this initial issue and installing a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a 3rd time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
