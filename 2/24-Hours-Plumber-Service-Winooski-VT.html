<h3>How to Overcome Sink Drain Problems in Winooski VT</h3>
<p>What is tough water? Clinically speaking, it is water that contains substantial amounts of liquified minerals, specifically calcium and magnesium. As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it picks up these minerals on its journey. Depending on the length of time the water takes a trip through the ground prior to reaching your tap, it can pick up a great deal of these minerals, making water harder in some areas than others. While the minerals will not harm your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water unsuitable-- and rather a nuisance-- for its numerous intended uses around your house.</p>
<p>Water hardness is the quantity of dissolved calcium and magnesium in the water-- tough water is high in both calcium and magnesium. The factor you can feel the difference on your skin is due to the fact that soap responds with the calcium to form soap scum. This results in the need for more soap or detergent to get things clean. Which's where the term firmness" originated from ... it's hard to wash in.</p>
