A fundamental part of our water quality program is the backflow prevention program When a water line is connected to devices including a nonpotable compound, this is referred to as a cross-connection. Contamination might take place when water streams through a cross-connection from a nonpotable source, such as a sprinkler system or cooling and heating system, into the potable water supply. This can happen through a procedure known as backflow.</p>
<p>The amount of hot water you use every day and whether your existing water heater has the ability to satisfy that demand. This quantity is usually based on the variety of people in your house.
