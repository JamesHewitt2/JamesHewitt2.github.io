<p>Every day you count on your water heater more than you might even recognize.

If you own a commercial property or company, it can cause a substantial disturbance in your company operations if your water heating devices stops working.</p>
<p>Read your insurance policy thoroughly if your polybutylene pipes have actually stopped working. Make certain you know what is covered and what is not covered. Lots of insurer will not cover a sluggish leak. Claims may be rejected due to the fact that the basic HO-3 property owners' policy specifically omits "a loss as the outcome of a water leak over a prolonged time period." Call your insurance agent and verify your protection. Double check with your agent to verify that your understanding is proper as soon as you have actually read through your policy and validated what is covered and what is not covered.</p>
