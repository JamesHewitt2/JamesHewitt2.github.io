<p>Spotty dishes? Circulation pipes transition to even smaller private service pipes, carrying water to individual houses, apartment services, shops and structures. Depending upon need, these pipes vary in size from a half inch in diameter to 6 inches. Water goes into the customer center through a water meter that tapes circulation rates and water usage for billing functions. Individual service pipelines are typically made from plastic, lead or Type K copper. And it is here at the point of application where the installation of a backflow preventer can be vital.</p>
<p>You also need to invest in a backflow valve if you observe your water has an uncommon circulation, taste, odor or color. A plumbing professional can determine whether the issue with your faucet is a quick fix or the result of other concerns in your home's plumbing system.
