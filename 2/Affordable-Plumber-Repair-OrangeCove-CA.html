Water goes into the customer center through a water meter that tapes circulation rates and water usage for billing functions. Individual service pipelines are typically made from plastic, lead or Type K copper. And it is here at the point of application where the installation of a backflow preventer can be vital.</p>
<p>You also need to invest in a backflow valve if you observe your water has an uncommon circulation, taste, odor or color.
