When those downspouts are linked to underground drains that circulation to community storm drains or street rain gutters, they sometimes end up being clogged with tree roots and debris. These kinds of blockages cause gutters to overflow and the weight of the water can trigger gutters to retreat from a house while causing water damage and rot to the structure.
