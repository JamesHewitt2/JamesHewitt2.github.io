I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was quite sensible. I will absolutely utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was super happy with their service.</p>
