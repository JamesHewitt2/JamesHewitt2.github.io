<h3>Clearing Blocked Drains at HaciendaHeights CA</h3>
<p>Corrosion is an intricate phenomenon and there are numerous elements that speed up corrosion in the drinking-water circulation system and premise plumbing. For years, there has actually been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and rust, making it important to distinguish between naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is destructive as it has a low pH and low TDS; however, cation -exchange water softening does not contribute to any aspects that accelerate rust Likewise, there is a lack of clinical evidence supporting the claim that hard-water scale is an efficient form of corrosion control. Hence, considering all these aspects, along with results from research study studies, WQA's position is that an appropriately configured cation -exchange water softener does not make water more corrosive.</p>
