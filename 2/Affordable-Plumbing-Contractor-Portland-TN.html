<p>Spotty meals? Circulation pipes transition to even smaller private service pipes, bring water to specific houses, apartment buildings, companies and shops. Depending on demand, these pipes vary in size from a half inch in size to 6 inches. Water gets in the consumer facility by means of a water meter that tape-records circulation rates and water utilization for billing purposes. Specific service pipelines are usually made from lead, plastic or type K copper. And it is here at the point of application where the installation of a backflow preventer can be crucial.</p>
