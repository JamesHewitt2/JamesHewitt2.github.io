<p>A. The toilet fill valve measurements we show are determined from the within bottom of the tank to the top of the fill valve. The threaded water supply shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not included in this measurement. The addition of a backflow preventer decreases water service pressure to the structure; extra, more significant costs can occur if the drop in water pressure ends up being a concern for homeowners. A PE or RA can assist identify if setting up a pump or larger size water service and backflow prevention device would neutralize the pressure loss.</p>
<p>I had a significant sewer problem with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I started calling any number I might find on Google. I in fact got their number for another company that could not come soon enough but referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and give me a quote. They instantly cleared the initial blockage, enabling the occupants to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon additional examination, there was a substantial clog that needed excavation to investigate. His team was on website the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this preliminary concern and setting up a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This took place yet a 3rd time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
