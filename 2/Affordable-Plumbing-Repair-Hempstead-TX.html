<p>As discussed earlier in the article, carbon monoxide gas is totally odorless and colorless. The only test for it is a carbon monoxide detector. Every home ought to have carbon monoxide detectors installed at the correct locations.

<p>The labor costs for disposal installation are primarily time associated. If whatever is prepared, in great condition, and the disposal is on hand and quickly put in, the plumber will likely only charge for an hour or 2 of time.
