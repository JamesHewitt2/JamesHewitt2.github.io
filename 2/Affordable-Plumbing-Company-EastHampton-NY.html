<h3>Emergency Plumbing Tips For Your Everyday Plumber EastHampton NY</h3>

Points at which a safe and clean water system gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in home appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, but they should be carefully designed and installed to prevent backflow. Another common area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>
