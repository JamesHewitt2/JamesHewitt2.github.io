<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively adapt to your business' circulation rates throughout the day. During durations of high flow demand, tanks come online to include flow rate capability. During durations of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation innovation, and it's probably the most essential development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
