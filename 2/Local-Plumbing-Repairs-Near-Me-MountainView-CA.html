A license is not needed for repairs which involve only the working parts of a faucet or valve or clearance of stoppages provided alterations are not made in the existing piping or fixtures. A common water softener includes a tall, narrow water-softener tank, and a short, broad salt water tank. The softener tank is connected to the house's water-supply line. A small-diameter fill tube connects the salt water tank to the softener tank. And a discharge hose runs from the softener tank to a nearby drain or drywell.</p>

<h3>Why Plumbers Are So Expensive MountainView CA</h3>
<p>Backflow means the undesirable reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the safe and clean water system; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from happening. Points at which a potable water supply connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in devices such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, but they should be thoroughly designed and installed to avoid backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water system.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a procedure in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at as much as 3,500 PSI. This allows the sewer lines to be cleaned up quickly and efficiently with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, giving off from the reverse and forward jets in the nozzle, move the hose through the line to remove debris such as tough water scale, grease, sand, and silt deposits.</p>
