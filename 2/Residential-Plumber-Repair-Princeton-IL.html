<h3>Blocked Drains in Princeton IL - Various Tools Used</h3>
<p>Solid Blockages: Professional assistance is the very best remedy, if you discover yourself presented with an especially persistent clog. You might wind up doing more harm than excellent if you continue to battle with it, which can develop permanent problems. Sewage back-flow is another significant concern if you do not have an expert look into your clog situation.</p>
<p>If you're buying a new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge bulk of toilets, the drain is focused about 12 in. from the wall. However with a few models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, simply determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't around 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. A lot of house centers bring only one or 2 10-in. designs and no 14-in. models. Be prepared to spend much more if you have to special-order a toilet. Likewise measure how far the bowl extends from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are replacing a toilet with a standard bowl with an elongated" model, the door may not close. Continue reading to find out how to install a toilet.</p>

Picture 3 shows how to set the slack just right.</p>
