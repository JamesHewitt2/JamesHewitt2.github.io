<p>With time, the resin beads in the water softener will end up being covered with calcium and magnesium ions, diminishing their capability to soften tough water. Through a process called regrowth, water is instantly flushed through the water softener with a concentrated quantity of regenerant. Now the resin beads pick up the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the solidity on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems include a whole home water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain. With the resin beads charged," the water softener goes back to service, supplying the entire home with clean, soft water.</p>
