<p>As one of the most used plumbing systems in your home, it's a given that your toilet will need repairs over time. But if your toilet is displaying any of the following indications, it may be time to replace it. We evaluate backflow requirements for services on an individual basis when a water account is developed. After removing standing water from the sink, pour about 1/2 cup of salt down the drain before you pour in the boiling water. Let it sit for a couple of minutes, and after that flush with warm water to clear the mix.</p>

<p>To prep your unit for installation, you might have to attach a cord with a plug to reach the outlet, or extension wires to reach a hardwired box In this case, I connected a cord with a plug package that I bought separately from the disposal system. It's as basic as feeding the wires from the cord through the disposal and attaching them to the matching colors on the unit with wire nuts.</p>
