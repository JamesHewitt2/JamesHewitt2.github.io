<p>Gradually, the resin beads in the water softener will end up being covered with calcium and magnesium ions, reducing their capacity to soften tough water. Through a procedure called regeneration, water is immediately flushed through the water softener with a focused quantity of regenerant.

WaterBoss water softener systems include a whole house water filtration with its patented self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the dissolved rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain. With the resin beads charged," the water softener returns to service, supplying the entire house with clean, soft water.</p>
