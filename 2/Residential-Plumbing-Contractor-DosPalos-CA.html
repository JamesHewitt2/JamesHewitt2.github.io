Wood pipes were utilized in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wooden tubes were extensively used in the USA during the 20th century. These pipes (utilized in place of corrugated iron or strengthened concrete pipes) were made from sections cut from brief lengths of wood. Locking of nearby rings with hardwood dowel pins produced a flexible structure.
