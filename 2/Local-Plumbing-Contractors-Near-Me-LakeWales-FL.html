They must be set up downstream from any shut down valves and can not be under pressure for more than 12 hours. If an GFAVB is used backflow prevention on an irrigation system you need to install one GFAVB after every valve for each zone in the system.  It must also be installed a minimum of 6 inches (150 mm) higher than the highest outlet in the system (some GFAVB makers, and some local officials, need that they be set up 12 inches (300 mm) greater than the highest outlet).
