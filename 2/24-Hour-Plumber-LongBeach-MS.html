I in fact got their number for another company that could not come quickly enough but referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and provide me a price quote. They instantly cleared the initial obstruction, enabling the renters to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon further examination, there was a considerable blockage that needed excavation to investigate.

After fixing this initial issue and setting up a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed.
