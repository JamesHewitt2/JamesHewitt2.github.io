<p>Softeners generally get rid of calcium (Ca2+) and magnesium (Mg2+) ions. Calcium and magnesium are often referred to as 'hardness minerals'. In addition, if your pipes are rattling, clanging, clacking and making more sound than they should be (more than water streaming through the pipes), that's a big red flag that something more major is incorrect with them.</p>
<p>During installation, water and electricity are turned off to the area. The old plumbing and sink flange are eliminated and cleaned up of any putty. Loosen the nuts that connect the drain pipe, including the curved trap, at the sink drain and near the wall or floor. Utilize your hands for PVC connections or a monkey wrench for metal connections. Place a pail beneath the drain pipe to catch any water that leaks out.</p>
