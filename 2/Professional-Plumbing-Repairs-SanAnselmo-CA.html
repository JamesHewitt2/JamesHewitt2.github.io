Transporting happens when the incoming hard water follows a narrow path through the softener's resin bed and does not exchange ions with the resin, leaving your water unsoftened.

<p>2. When they sense their softening capacity is low as identified by a pre-programmed number entered by the user, demand-initiated softeners regenerate. The preset number represents the quantity of time in between each regeneration. For instance, a lower picked number means your softener will regrow less typically.
