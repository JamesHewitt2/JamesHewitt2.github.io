<p>The most basic mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a portable disc connected to a climatic vent. In the event of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop below that of the outside air. This activates the disc to open, allowing air to bring back and get in the valve pressure comparable to ambient atmospheric requirement. This repair of pressure breaks the siphon and avoids cross contamination.</p>

<h3>How To Keep Bathroom Sinks Running Smoothly in Joppa MD</h3>

<p>To prep your unit for installation, you may have to connect a cord with a plug to reach the outlet, or extension wires to reach a hardwired box In this case, I attached a cord with a plug package that I bought individually from the disposal unit. It's as simple as feeding the wires from the cord through the disposal and attaching them to the matching colors on the unit with wire nuts.</p>
