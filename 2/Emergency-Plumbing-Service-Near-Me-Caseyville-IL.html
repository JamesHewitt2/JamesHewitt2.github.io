<p>Backflow preventers should only be fixed when the information gathered from the field test shows the assembly has deteriorated in its performance below the developed minimum standard. The test treatment is a diagnostic evaluation of the operations of a backflow preventer. When the backflow preventer stops working to fulfill this minimum standard, the backflow preventer should be repaired or if required, changed. These minimum standards are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly starts to weaken in its performance, it can still avoid backflow. The purpose of a repair is to return the assembly back to its initial factory working specs. This indicates the assembly is repaired so that it can carry out above the minimum standard.</p>
