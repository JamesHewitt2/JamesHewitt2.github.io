<p>There's no part of your home that has more of a direct effect on your safety, convenience, comfort, and reliability than your plumbing system. This is extremely important! When you have cast iron drain lines you need 3-5 gallons of water that an older toilet supplies to press the waste out of your drain system. Existing guidelines restrict the amount of water a toilet can utilize per flush to 1.28 gallons per flush which can leave particles accumulating in cast iron drain lines. We offer two types of water treatment systems for difficult water: Advantage Series Salt Water Softeners and NaturSoft ® Water Softener Alternatives.</p>
<p>After professional drain cleaning, there are a couple of things you can do to keep your drains clear. Prevent putting grease or oil down the drains. Utilize a solution of baking soda and vinegar occasionally to keep your drains and waste disposal unit clean. You can utilize a natural drain cleaner regular monthly to keep your drains clear. We advise natural items, such as Bio-Clean, due to the fact that they work better than items including harsh chemicals and will not trigger damage to your drains or components.</p>
