<p>I had a significant sewer problem with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I started calling any number I might find on Google. I actually got their number for another company that couldn't come quickly enough but referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to examine and offer me a quote. They instantly cleared the preliminary blockage, allowing for the occupants to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon more investigation, there was a considerable clog that needed excavation to investigate. His team was on website the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this initial problem and setting up a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a 3rd time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
