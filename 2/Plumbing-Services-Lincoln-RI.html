<p>It's quite typical for debris to wind up being flushed down our drains. Think about how frequently food particles, cooking oil and hair winds up in our sinks and showers.

<p>The main distinction amongst water softener designs is in the method they arrange the backflush cycles. This is important because recharging the beads with salt prematurely wastes salt and water.

It likewise traps debris and prevents the development of obstructions. Leaks in this system, are more than likely a result of a loose connection, rust, and, obstructions.</p>

<p>The key to the technology is being able to control both the crystal development rate and their elimination from our polymer beads, thereby eliminating firmness ions and producing a water softening benefit that does not need replacement chemicals or regrowth of active sites," specified Dr. Rakesh Govind, co-founder of SofTap Water and primary technology officer. This technology is more cost effective and lasts longer than common water softening products such as ion exchange or reverse osmosis," continued Dr. Govind.</p>
