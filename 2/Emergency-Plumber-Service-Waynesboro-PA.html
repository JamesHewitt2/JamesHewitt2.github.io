I actually got their number for another company that could not come soon enough however referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and give me a price quote. They right away cleared the preliminary clog, enabling the renters to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon further examination, there was a significant clog that required excavation to examine. His team was on website the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this initial issue and installing a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed.
