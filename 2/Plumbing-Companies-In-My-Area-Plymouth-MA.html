<p>We concentrate on tub and shower replacement and full bathroom remodeling at very competitive rates. Switch on the gas and inspect connections for leakages by brushing a 50-50 mixture of dishwashing liquid and water over the joints. You have a leak if the mixture bubbles. Tighten or reconnect joints that leak. Clean the joints dry when completed. Call the plumbing inspector to check over your work. Follow the how-to suggestions that accompanies the images to ensure the connections are tight.</p>
<p>The HydroFLOW water conditioner keeps minerals, algae, and bacteria from becoming an issue in your water system by sending out an electrical signal of 150 kilohertz (kHz) through your plumbing system. The signal causes the minerals to join together, forming clusters that eventually form steady crystals. These crystals do not cling to surfaces like specific minerals would.</p>
