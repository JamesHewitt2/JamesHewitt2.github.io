<p>A clogged drain is another typical repair - primarily with sinks. In many cases, a sink drain problem is brought on by extreme pollutants or debris inside the drain like hair, grease, hair care products or soaps.

ABS and PVC are not in fact glued in the routine sense of gluing. The so-called "glue" is really a solvent that melts the surfaces of the pipe and fitting for a few seconds. Broken Pipes: Pipes are broken, punctured or collapsed by moving soil, frozen ground, settling, and so on</p>
<p>Call a plumber: If the clog is not in the P-trap and water streams easily from the sink drain into your pail, then it's time to call a plumber The clog is most likely even more down the line. Leaking sewer lines inside your house can harm floors, woodworking, and other important things such as cabinets.
