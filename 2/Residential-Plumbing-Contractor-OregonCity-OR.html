<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is just half the formula! To just pour some media inside a tank and hope for the very best is common in our market and numerous companies try to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Again, years of experience and thorough testing led us to create a tank that fluidizes the media bed better than any other design on the marketplace. Fluidization is the essential to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media transforms the solidity in the water to calcite crystals which will not adhere to anything even under extreme temperatures. It's only with the media and the fluidization properly interacting that you can accomplish this.</p>
