<p>Sinkholes do not only happen in your lawn, unfortunately, when a sewer line breaks.

In this case, you'll need skilled plumbers as well as foundation repair experts.</p>
<p>A home's service line (also known as a sewer lateral) runs from the house to the mainline sewer in the street.

<h3>Things You Should Do Before Seeking An Emergency Plumbing Repair Service Leander TX</h3>
<p>The leak from a pipe fitting that costs less than a dollar can easily trigger thousands of dollars in water damage, interrupt your household for weeks, and throw your remodel way off schedule. So employing a licensed, insured master plumber (or a trained apprentice working under his license) is a no-brainer. But not all plumbers manage all kinds of work. Their responsibilities break out into two classifications: Plumbers who deal with standard repairs (often in emergency scenarios), and plumbers who concentrate on remodeling tasks and additions.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a procedure in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at approximately 3,500 PSI. This allows the sewer lines to be cleaned rapidly and effectively with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, emitting from the forward and reverse jets in the nozzle, move the hose through the line to remove particles such as tough water scale, silt, sand, and grease deposits.</p>
