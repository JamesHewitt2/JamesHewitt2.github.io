<p>To determine which toilet valve is triggering the problem, look at the overflow tube. There's a problem with the toilet fill valve if water is overruning into the tube. If the water level is listed below the top of television, the flush valve is leaking, allowing water to trickle into the bowl. That sluggish, consistent outflow of water prevents the fill valve from closing completely. We removed the fronts and backs of new toilets to show you how to replace these toilet tank parts. Your toilet and toilet tank parts will not look so pristine inside. You'll discover scummy surface areas, water stains and deterioration. However don't be squeamish-- the water is as clean as the things that comes out of your faucets.</p>
