<p>Recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line between their brand-new home and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we used our sewer camera to inspect the line and figure out the reason for the issue.

Even worse, the line could collapse requiring a significant repair or replacement.</p>
