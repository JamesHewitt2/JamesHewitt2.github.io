No matter what sort of water heater you have or have an interest in, the specialists at Timothy Off can help. Contact us today for our hot water heater installation services. For example, if your kitchen sink is backed up due to the fact that you flushed potato peels down the disposal, a quick drain snaking can separate the obstruction and send it down the pipes. We suggest you opt for drain snaking instead of utilizing strong chemical drain cleaners. These store-bought cleaners might do more damage than good by rusting your pipes.</p>
