<p>The average life expectancy of an electric water heater is more than that of a gas one. Unseen sets of pipes utilize pressure to move water through supply lines and out faucets, showerheads or into your toilet. In a different drain pathway, small pipes run from the tub and sink to ultimately meet up with a larger one underneath the toilet, bring waste and wastewater from the bathroom and ultimately out of the home.</p>
<p>The Final Jeopardy answer, you ask? The device that controls water flow in your toilet. You'll see a supply line that runs from the outlet in the wall to the bottom of the toilet fill valve if you look behind your toilet. This is how water gets into your toilet. After you flush the toilet, the fill valve opens to refill the water in the tank and the toilet bowl, readying the system for the next flush. If your fill valve is broken, not set at the right level, or isn't installed effectively, you might experience an often or continuously "running" toilet - which can cost you hundreds of dollars in wasted water.</p>

<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to operate, the control valve or valves must stay open and the system must be continuously kept track of. Therefore, there is a device on each control valve that either avoids the valve from being closed or sends out an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as easy as a locked chain through the control valve that prevents that valve from opening, or an alarm that alerts the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems use both approaches. NFPA 13 refers to all such devices as supervisory devices.</p>
