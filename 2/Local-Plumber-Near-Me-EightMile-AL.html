<p>If you have read the paragraph above, you now comprehend that there various mechanical parts within your toilet's tank that allow your toilet to flush the thin down the toilet bowl. When these parts end up being used or break they need to be replaced.

<p>I can't say enough good things about this company. Had a sewer repair needed and had an extremely short amount of time due to closing on a home sale. Every person I experienced from Marquita doing logistics for my job to every member of the work team. Friendly, communicated well, absolutely responsive and actually cared to help me through this extremely demanding job. All of individuals I experienced were role models for what a well run service organisation should be. Much thanks and gratitude. You're terrific.</p>
