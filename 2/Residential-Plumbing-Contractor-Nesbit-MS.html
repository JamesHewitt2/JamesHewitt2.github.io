<p>LM Building And Construction and Mechanical is the warm water heater installation and replacement specialist in Santa Fe, our team has actually set up and changed thousands of hot water heater across northern New Mexico.

<p>The majority of houses or buildings that were constructed in the 1970s usually have galvanized piping. Gradually, the plumbing system can wear out and the pipes can start to wear away. This can trigger low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to provide weather security. As the outer finish of zinc starts to deteriorate, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, causing the iron to eventually rust.</p>
<p>Just recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line in between their brand-new home and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we used our sewer camera to check the line and identify the cause of the problem. The line was clearly degrading; some areas were only held together by the ground around them. Another clog loomed. Even worse, the line might collapse requiring a major repair or replacement.</p>
