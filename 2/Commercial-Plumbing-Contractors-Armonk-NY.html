The waste disposal unit is one of the most misused devices in the entire house. Few property owners understand that a disposal is developed specifically to deal with food residue washed from a plate-- not entire pieces of leftovers! Large quantities of food can rapidly overwhelm the system and cause a comprehensive clog. That's why Pratt Plumbing gets a lot of call requesting waste disposal unit repairs and maintenance.</p>
<p>The HydroFLOW water conditioner keeps minerals, algae, and bacteria from becoming an issue in your water supply by sending an electrical signal of 150 kilohertz (kHz) through your plumbing system. The signal causes the minerals to join together, forming clusters that eventually form steady crystals. These crystals do not cling to surface areas like individual minerals would.</p>
