The pre-programmed number represents the quantity of time in between each regeneration. For instance, a lower selected number suggests your softener will regenerate less often.

<p>During typical operation, the pressure in between the 2 check valves, described as the zone of decreased pressure, is kept at a lower pressure than the supply pressure. If either check valve must leak, the relief valve is developed to open and discharge water to the exterior. An RPZ will regularly release small amounts of water due to fluctuation in line pressure up or downstream of the assembly. For this factor, the RPZ must be set up in locations that are not subject to water damage and allow adequate drainage.</p>
