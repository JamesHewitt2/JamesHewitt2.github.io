<p>Visible smell. The moment you smell sewage (a rotten egg-like odor) in the backyard, basement, or anywhere in your house or company area, give us a call. That odor might be originating from your sewer system, which needs repair work right away. If your vent stack, the part of your plumbing system that removes sewage from your house, launches sewer gas, and controls atmospheric pressure in the waste-system pipes has stopped working, it will typically need to be replaced rather than fixed. If your pipes are gurgling or emitting foul odors, you'll understand this.</p>
