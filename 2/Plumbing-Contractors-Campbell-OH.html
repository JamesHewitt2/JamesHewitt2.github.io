Get rid of excess plumber's putty.</p>
<p>Back siphonage happens when water is drawn or pulled backwards due to the fact that of unfavorable or decreased pressure in the supply side of the water supply.

Secure the drain hose securely and feed it into the devoted drain, like a floor drain or utility sink. To avoid the hose back siphoning drainage, all drain hoses must have an air gap. Completion of the hose be at least 2 inches above the dedicated drain. An air gap might be used to accomplish this, and may be required depending on local plumbing codes.</p>
