<p>When a garbage disposal breaks, it is probably just a matter of time before your sink starts to clog, as you and other home members are most likely not used to guaranteeing that no obstructive food waste decreases your drain. Those liquified solids can trigger a flaky buildup on everything from meals, to pipes, to the heating components of your appliances, to your own body.

<p>Remodeling plumbers normally charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one guy and a truck. Once again, this does not include the cost of parts. But a growing number of plumbers are charging "by the component," and their bids are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the fixtures themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily invest a lot more. With this approach, you know the turnkey rate entering into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's responsibility, not yours.</p>
