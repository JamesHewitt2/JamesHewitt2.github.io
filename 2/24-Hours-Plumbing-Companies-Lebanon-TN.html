In 2010, for example, trainees at a Bowling Green, Kentucky elementary school suffered nausea and other signs after a contractor dealing with the HVAC system triggered the antifreeze chemical glycol to backflow into the school's drinking supply.</p>
<p>Frequent leaks: Leaks coming from your water heater are never a good sign. If your hot water heater has regular leakages or is continuously requiring repairs, it is likely more cost-effective to replace the whole unit.

Its sole task is to avoid drinking water from being polluted due to backflow.</p>
