Dura PEX tends to have a great deal of oxidization. This causes cracks in the tubing that can cause leaks. As these leakages happen, zinc is leached from the fittings on the pipes, triggering them to degrade. Lastly, chlorinated water has actually been found to cause fractures in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the very best option to all of these problems.</p>
