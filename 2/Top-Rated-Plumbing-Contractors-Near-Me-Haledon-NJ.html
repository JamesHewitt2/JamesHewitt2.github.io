Indoor gas leakages from heaters, stoves, ovens and other gas-burning appliances take place most frequently in the winter. This is due to the fact that houses are not adequately ventilated during the cooler months to prevent heat loss. We suggest setting up carbon monoxide detectors outside of bedroom doors to alert you of any possible gas leaks if you haven't done so currently.</p>
