<h3>What To Do About Burst Pipes In The Middle Of The Night Gainesville GA</h3>
<p>Backflow implies the undesirable reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the drinkable supply of water; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from happening.

Such connections happen naturally in home appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, but they must be carefully developed and installed to prevent backflow. Another typical location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>
