<p>A water softener is a whole-house filtration system that eliminates hardness-causing calcium and magnesium minerals from your water through a procedure called ion exchange.  A water softener addresses among the most common and disastrous water problems: hard water.  Tough water ruined the contemporary house. Scale develops in your pipes, blocking them and decreasing water pressure.  Scale significantly reduces the life-span of home appliances like dishwashers, coffee machine and ice devices. Tough water destroys warm water devices. The higher the temperature level of the water, the more calcium and magnesium will strengthen and harden into solid deposits inside your hot water heater.</p>
