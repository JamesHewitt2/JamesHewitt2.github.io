Throughout regeneration, salty water from the salt water tank flows up the fill tube and into the softener tank. A rinse cycle commences and the salty water washes the mineral deposits off the resin beads. The regenerated water and the mineral deposits are eliminated the discharge hose. The system then reverts back to softening the incoming water.</p>
<p>Sooner or later, however, the beads reach optimal capability and can't attract anymore mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank need to be regrowed, or, flushed clean. That's where the brine tank is available in. An on-board computer system determines the amount of water that flows through the softener. When it reaches the preprogrammed setting, regeneration immediately starts. For a three-bedroom house and family of four, regrowth typically happens every 12,000 gallons.</p>
