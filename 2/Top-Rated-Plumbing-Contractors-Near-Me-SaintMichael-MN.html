<p>Though water line replacement seems like your home's equivalent of significant surgical treatment, it's really something we at Gotelli Plumbing deal with regularly. When your water lines are repiped, it simply implies old copper and galvanized pipes are changed with new pipes. We find that homes 15 years or older who have never ever had repiping work are the most likely candidates for water line replacement. If you have an older house and are experiencing regular and major leakages, you might be in need of water line repiping. We discover that repiping can actually be the more affordable and much better long-lasting option if you do have frequent leaks.</p>
