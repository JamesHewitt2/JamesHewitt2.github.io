<p>When a flush valve triggers a toilet to run, a used flapper is normally the culprit. But not constantly. Initially, take a look at the chain that raises the flapper. It can tangle up and prevent the flapper from closing securely if there's too much slack in the chain. A chain with too little slack can cause problem too. Photo 3 demonstrates how to set the slack perfect.</p>
