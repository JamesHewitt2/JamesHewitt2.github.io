<p>Backpressure backflow is brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable water system pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable water system pressure, or a mix of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in potable water supply pressure occur whenever the amount of water being used surpasses the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
