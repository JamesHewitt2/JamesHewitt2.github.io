Well, we still recommend you have a backflow preventer set up anywhere incoming water and wastewater might be cross-connected.</p>
<p>Once the elements are put back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is prepared to be pressurized. It is necessary to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the downside shut off remains in the closed position. This enables the parts to transfer to their pressurized positions in a precise motion. When the assembly is pressurized, then any built up air needs to be gotten rid of from the body. The majority of backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be removed from critical locations in the assembly. In some designs, test cocks can be utilized to get rid of air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in an area where the air will build up.</p>
