<p>If you need a water softener is a personal preference, figuring out. A license is not required for repairs which include just the working parts of a faucet or valve or clearance of stoppages provided changes are not made in the existing piping or components. A typical water softener includes a high, narrow water-softener tank, and a short, broad brine tank. The softener tank is linked to the house's water-supply line. A small-diameter fill tube connects the brine tank to the softener tank. And a discharge hose runs from the softener tank to a neighboring drainpipe or drywell.</p>
<p>Aside from these 2 crucial parts, there are a myriad of small, possibly less vital things that can break or degrade.

You might need a brand-new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting properly. Bulges in the supply line can burst and trigger a leak.
