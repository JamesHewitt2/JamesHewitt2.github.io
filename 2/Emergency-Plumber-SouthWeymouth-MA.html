<p>This is a bad indication. Toilets need to absolutely never wobble, shift, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing. That toilet needs to be replaced if you can move a toilet around by doing anything less extreme than swinging a sledgehammer at it. Incorrectly seated and sealed toilets might leak, damage plumbing, and even compromise the structural stability of the home.</p>
<p>Leaks can occur if the seal in between the tank and bowl fails, or the seal at the floor drain stops working.

Toilets are heavy and if you drop it you have a a lot more pricey repair. Ryan's Plumbing has thoroughly trained personnel who will treat your toilet and house with the utmost care.</p>
