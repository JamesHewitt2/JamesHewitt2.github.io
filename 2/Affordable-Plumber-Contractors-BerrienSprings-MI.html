<h3>Know The Work Of The Commercial Plumber BerrienSprings MI</h3>
<p>PEX pipes were believed to be a better alternative to polybutylene and galvanized piping. Unfortunately, one brand is experiencing a great deal of problems: Dura PEX.

As these leaks occur, zinc is leached from the fittings on the pipes, causing them to deteriorate. Lastly, chlorinated water has actually been found to cause cracks in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the very best solution to all of these concerns.</p>
