The Pipe Pull technique interchanges damaged sewer or water lines with new piping by the usage of a small hole at the front and back of the piping run. The broken sewer line guides the new piping into place. All new replacement pipes have a forecasted life expectancy of one hundred years and are code compliant, chemical-resistant, root-resistant, and leak evidence. Another efficient strategy is pipe relining. Pipe relining essentially gets rid of the need for broken pipe elimination.
