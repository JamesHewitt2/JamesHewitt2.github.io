<p>A clogged drain is another common repair - mainly with sinks. For the most part, a sink drain concern is brought on by extreme impurities or debris inside the drain like hair, grease, hair care items or soaps. While there are several chemical drain cleaning options, in some cases this can trigger more damage than assistance. Anytime you discover a clogged drain, reach out to Resurrection Plumbing to diagnose the issue and suggest the right repairs.</p>
