<p>Wooden pipes were utilized in London and elsewhere throughout the 16th and 17th centuries. The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a small hole in which the water would travel through. 21 The numerous pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wood pipes were used in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wooden tubes were commonly utilized in the USA throughout the 20th century. These pipes (used in place of corrugated iron or enhanced concrete pipes) were made of areas cut from short lengths of wood. Locking of nearby rings with hardwood dowel pins produced a flexible structure. About 100,000 feet of these wood pipes were installed during WW2 in drainage culverts, storm sewers and channels, under highways and at army camps, naval stations, airfields and ordnance plants.</p>

This is the first barrier in the Cedar Rapids Water Division's multi-barrier disinfection procedure.</p>
