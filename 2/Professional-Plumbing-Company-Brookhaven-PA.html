<p>Water softening refers to the removal of magnesium, calcium, and other minerals from water. The most popular approach of water softening is through a procedure called ion exchange. Throughout ion exchange, mineral ions are traded for another type of ion-- generally salt. The result is water that's been effectively softened by eliminating almost all traces of the minerals that constitute difficult water.</p>

<p>A leaking toilet can lose water and cause water damage, and a running toilet wastes up to 7,500 gallons of water each year, causing water expenses to increase.

<h3>Working Consistently With Your Emergency Plumber Brookhaven PA</h3>
<p>To reduce the need of gas line repair, it's important to understand the common reasons for gas leaks. Indoor gas leaks from heaters, ranges, ovens and other gas-burning home appliances occur most typically in the winter. Because homes are not sufficiently ventilated during the cooler months to prevent heat loss, this is. We suggest installing carbon monoxide detectors outside of bed room doors to alert you of any potential gas leaks if you haven't done so currently.</p>
<p>Water softeners work through a process called ion exchange which gets rid of calcium and magnesium from the water. When the hard water participates in the mineral tank, it streams through a bed of spherical resin beads These plastic beads, normally made from polystyrene, are charged with a salt ion. The resin beads are anions, meaning they have a negative charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a positive charge, making them cations. Since opposite charges attract, the negative charge of the minerals is attracted to the favorable charge of the resin beads. As the tough water passes through the resin, the beads grab ahold of the mineral ions and eliminate them from the water. When the bead seizes the mineral ion, the salt ion is launched. The column of resin strips all the solidity out of the water as it passes through the mineral tank, and softened water drains into your house.</p>
