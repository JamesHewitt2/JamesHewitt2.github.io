<p>Backpressure backflow is brought on by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable water system pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable water system pressure, or a combination of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature level boosts in boilers, and so on. Reductions in drinkable water supply pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being used exceeds the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
