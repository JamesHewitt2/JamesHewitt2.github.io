<p>IRWD is committed to providing safe, high quality water to clients. Our extensive water quality program runs 24 hr a day, 365 days a year, to make sure that the water delivered to our customers is kept devoid of harmful impurities. A vital part of our water quality program is the backflow prevention program When a water line is linked to devices containing a nonpotable compound, this is called a cross-connection. Contamination may occur when water flows through a cross-connection from a nonpotable source, such as a sprinkler system or heating & cooling system, into the safe and clean water system. This can occur through a procedure known as backflow.</p>
<p>Leaks can occur if the seal between the tank and bowl stops working, or the seal at the floor drain stops working. Either of these leakages can be tough to fix on your own since the tank or the entire toilet must be lifted off the floor for a correct repair. Toilets are heavy and if you drop it you have a a lot more costly repair. Ryan's Plumbing has actually thoroughly trained personnel who will treat your toilet and house with the utmost care.</p>
<p>A. The toilet fill valve measurements we reveal are determined from the inside bottom of the tank to the top of the fill valve. The threaded water supply shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not included in this measurement. The addition of a backflow preventer reduces water service pressure to the building; additional, more significant costs can occur if the drop in water pressure becomes a concern for residents. If setting up a pump or bigger size water service and backflow prevention device would counteract the pressure loss, a PE or RA can assist figure out.</p>
