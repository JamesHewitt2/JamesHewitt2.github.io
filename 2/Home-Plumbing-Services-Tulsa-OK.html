<p>All of the drains in your home, from your toilets, sinks, tubs, and showers all drain into one main drain under your house then leave into the sewer or septic system from your house. Then that usually indicates that your main sewer line is backing up when you experience obstructions in several drains at once in your home. This can occur in multiple areas and any mix of drains. For instance, water may fill up in your bathtub when you run your washing machine. There are a number of combinations of this kind of backup. The point is your drains all connect, and as soon as you have a backup in your main sewer line, you'll experience backup and overflowing from several drain lines in your home.</p>
