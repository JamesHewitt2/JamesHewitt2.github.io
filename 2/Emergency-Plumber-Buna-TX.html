When figuring out the hardness of water, there are ranges of grains per gallon (gpg). Rinckey said that both Belding and Greenville city water measures around 18 gpg, which is considered exceptionally difficult water, leaving telltale signs like spotty glasses and soap scum that is next to difficult to eliminate. With well water, these signs may likewise be paired with iron spots and sulfur-smells originating from the tap.</p>

For several years, there has been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and rust, making it crucial to compare naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is corrosive as it has a low pH and low TDS; however, cation -exchange water softening does not contribute to any factors that speed up corrosion Likewise, there is an absence of scientific evidence supporting the claim that hard-water scale is an effective type of corrosion control. Thus, thinking about all these aspects, along with results from research studies, WQA's position is that an appropriately configured cation -exchange water softener does not make water more corrosive.</p>
