<p>A. The toilet fill valve measurements we show are measured from the within bottom of the tank to the top of the fill valve. The threaded water supply shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not included in this measurement. The addition of a backflow preventer minimizes water service pressure to the building; extra, more substantial costs can happen if the drop in water pressure ends up being a problem for locals. A PE or RA can help determine if installing a pump or bigger size water service and backflow prevention device would counteract the pressure loss.</p>
<p>Take the example of the instantaneous hot shower that uses the point-of-use water heaters; these devices will provide hot water constantly for the duration you are utilizing the shower. They will stop to work only if there are power issues or if the hot water heater is malfunctioning. In essence, it warms the water on demand with simply the quantity you need, thus taking away the loss incurred with using storage tank hot water heater where the water cools and is then reheated.</p>
