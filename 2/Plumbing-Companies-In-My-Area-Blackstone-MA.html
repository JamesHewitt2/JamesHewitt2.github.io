<p>The Bureau of Plumbing and Gasfitting Inspections is a division of the Department of Permits, Approvals and Inspections and is responsible for checking work carried out by licensed plumbers and gasfitters to ensure conformity with the plumbing and gas code.

<p>The Plumbing and Gasfitting Board advises the Director of the Department of Permits, Approvals and Inspections regarding the administration of Post 21, Title 15 of the Baltimore County Code, including licensing. Backsiphonage takes place when there is a negative pressure in the water distribution system, which draws the water from a private water supply into the general public water system. This can take place at any time, such as throughout a water pipe break or throughout a big firefighting effort.</p>
<p>Other signs you might need to repipe consist of rust in your water supply, low water pressure, and damp areas in your walls, floor, or ceiling. While these prevail signs that precede repiping services, they do not always imply repiping is the only option. Contact our Brenham plumbers and we will take a look at the problem to figure out the very best course of action.</p>
