<p>In water distribution systems, water is normally kept at a significant pressure to allow water to flow from the tap, shower, or other component. Water pressure might fail or be minimized when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is unexpectedly high need on the water system (for instance, when numerous fire hydrants are opened). Decreased pressure in the pipe may enable polluted water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
<p>A waste disposal unit must not leak. When this happens, it normally indicates wear and tear which is a fair indication that its time is up.
