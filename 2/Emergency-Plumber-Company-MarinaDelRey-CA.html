<p>In basic, toilets are pretty easy to run and repair. Almost any part can be removed and changed fairly quickly and quickly The flipside of the toilet's low maintenance nature is, when it has a problem, the stakes are high. Harmed toilets can do some truly comprehensive, expensive, and ... smelly damage to a house. When something goes wrong, and your kitchen sink starts backing up, your toilet will not flush, or you can't take a shower, you need for professional help immediately.
