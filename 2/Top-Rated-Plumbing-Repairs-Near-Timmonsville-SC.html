<p>Pull the 2 lines out of the trimmer, one at a time. Dispose of the harmed fuel lines.

<p>Pre-action sprinkler systems generally are set up in locations where water might cause disastrous damage, such as in freezers, computer spaces, and areas with electronic equipment. The piping in a pre-action system includes air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized. Water to the system is kept back by the pre-action valve, which is connected to a fire detection system. If a fire happens, the detection system sends a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then allows water into the system's piping. The water is discharged through the open sprinkler.</p>

<p>This is particularly typical after returning from a holiday or not utilizing your house's supply of water for a prolonged period of time.

<p>The simplest mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a portable disc attached to an atmospheric vent. In the event of a siphon, the pressure in the valve will drop listed below that of the outside air. This sets off the disc to open, permitting air to restore and go into the valve pressure comparable to ambient atmospheric requirement. This remediation of pressure breaks the siphon and avoids cross contamination.</p>
