<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, efficient, and a great person. He informed me exactly what to anticipate (cost, time, process) up front and delivered as assured. I will absolutely use Clog Dawg once again. Installing a garbage disposal takes 2 to 3 hours with an average per hour rate of $25 to $70. These prices are in addition to the cost of the disposal unit. If your plumber has a minimum callout cost that is higher than the labor cost for the work, the total you pay might be higher.</p>
<p>Installation and replacement costs are typically similar, though replacement normally will not need service charges, such as application charges. New meters need to satisfy guidelines and code requirements for their placement, and gas suppliers might need a special meter for their services, limiting your choices. Layout - Once you include a 2nd floor and even 3rd floor, pipes need to be added to it. This is more intricate than plumbing the ground floor and is more labor intensive. Plumbing services will use more materials which contributes to your labor costs.</p>
