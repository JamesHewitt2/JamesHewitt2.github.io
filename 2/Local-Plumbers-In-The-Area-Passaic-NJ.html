<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is only half the formula! To just pour some media inside a tank and hope for the very best is common in our industry and numerous companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Once again, years of experience and thorough testing led us to design a tank that fluidizes the media bed much better than any other design on the market. Fluidization is the crucial to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media transforms the solidity in the water to calcite crystals which will not stay with anything even under extreme temperature levels. It's only with the media and the fluidization correctly collaborating that you can attain this.</p>
