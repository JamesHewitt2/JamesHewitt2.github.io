<p>All of the drains in your house, from your toilets, sinks, tubs, and showers all drain into one main drain under your home then leave into the sewer or septic system from your house. When you experience clogs in multiple drains at once in your house, then that usually suggests that your main sewer line is backing up. This can take place in numerous areas and any mix of drains. For example, water might fill up in your bathtub when you run your washing machine. There are numerous combinations of this type of backup.

<p>You live in an older house. If your house is 50 years old or older and you have actually never ever changed its pipes, there's a great chance that you'll need to have it done quickly.

If so, you might need to add a grounded outlet to power the waste disposal unit if you do not already have one. This usually adds anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the general cost of the garbage disposal installation.</p>
