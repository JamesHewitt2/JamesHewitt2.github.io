<h3>Emergency Plumbing Services Aston PA</h3>
<p>Backflow indicates the unwanted turnaround of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the safe and clean water system; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from occurring. Points at which a drinkable water supply connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, but they should be carefully developed and set up to avoid backflow. Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water system.</p>
