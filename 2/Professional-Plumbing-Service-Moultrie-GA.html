This is typically the case when the hot water heater is more than ten years old or the cost of repairs would amount to more than half the cost of an entire brand-new unit. Often a troublesome toilet just requires a minor change and life is back to regular. That is why we provide a 4-point toilet tune-up, where we (1) adjust the flush, (2) clean the seals, (3) replace the flapper and (4) carry out a dye test.</p>
<p>Installing a gas line to power a hot water heater and heater normally costs $350 to $600. On top of the gas line costs, heater installation expenses range from $2,150 to $5,900.
