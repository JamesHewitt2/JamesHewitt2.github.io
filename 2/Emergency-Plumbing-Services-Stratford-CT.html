<p>A water softener is a whole-house filtration system that removes hardness-causing calcium and magnesium minerals from your water through a process called ion exchange.  A water softener addresses one of the most disastrous and common water problems: tough water.  Tough water damaged the contemporary home. Scale builds up in your pipes, clogging them and reducing water pressure.  Scale significantly reduces the lifespan of devices like dishwashing machines, coffee machine and ice makers. Tough water destroys hot water appliances. The higher the temperature level of the water, the more calcium and magnesium will solidify and harden into solid deposits inside your warm water heater.</p>
