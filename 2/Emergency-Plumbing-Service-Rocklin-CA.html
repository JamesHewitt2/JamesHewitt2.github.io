<p>Typically, there are tank water heaters that use either gas or electrical power for their fuel. Natural gas tank units utilize nearly 50% less energy, costing less to operate, than the electric range. However, they cost a bit more than electrical designs. When either temperature or pressure goes beyond predetermined levels, they also include a temperature level and pressure-release valve that opens. We supply gas water heater service, along with electrical hot water heater service, throughout Central New Jersey and the Jersey Shore.</p>

Its sole task is to avoid drinking water from being contaminated due to backflow.</p>
