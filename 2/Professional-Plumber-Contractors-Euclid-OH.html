<p>The economics of new high-efficiency water softeners. A clogged drain can make any of your plumbing fixtures inoperable. Whether you have a sink that doesn't drain appropriately or a shower that holds water for too long, a Sears Handyman can assist. In some cases drain repair requirements can be fixed reasonably quickly by a knowledgeable handyman. At other times, however, portions of a drain might need to be dismantled, taken a look at, and cleared before being replaced. In many cases, a handyman may determine that a replacement part is required (like a tailpiece, pvc, or reducer  trap) to guarantee normal operation for your drain. Call a Sears Handyman representative today to talk about repair alternatives.</p>

<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to run, the control valve or valves should remain open and the system must be continuously kept track of. For that reason, there is a device on each control valve that either prevents the valve from being closed or sends out an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as simple as a locked chain through the control valve that prevents that valve from opening, or an alarm that alerts the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems utilize both techniques. NFPA 13 refers to all such gadgets as supervisory gadgets.</p>
<p>Liners are another popular product sewer cleaners sell nowadays. A liner is a fabric tube covered on one side with a layer of PVC, which is embedded with a two-part epoxy resin.
