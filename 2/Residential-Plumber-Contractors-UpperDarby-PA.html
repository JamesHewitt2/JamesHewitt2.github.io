<p>Backflow preventers are important for creating a safe supply of water system. No matter which model you select, all water softeners need to be correctly maintained. The salt water service should be mixed and stored in the salt water tank. Periodic obstructing of the resin likewise requires unique attention. For example, if the raw supply of water is turbid it may clog the resin with mud and clay. Often, regular backwashing with water will fix this issue. If not, slowly stir the resin throughout the backwash cycle to help separate the material. Also, bacteria and fungi likewise form mats in the resin that lower its efficiency. Decontaminating the water prior to softening or regularly cleaning the softener with chlorine bleach will get rid of these nuisances. Nevertheless, read the manufacturer's instructions prior to including any chemicals to the system.</p>
<p>Next, test the flapper as shown in Photo 1. Water is most likely getting away through a split or worn away overflow tube if extra pressure on the flapper doesn't stop the running sound.
