<p>Hidden water leaks are often difficult and have Potentially Serious Repercussions. Changing your flapper may require slightly different actions than we reveal (Photos 2 and 3). Your flapper might screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. If you have an unusual flush valve, finding a replacement flapper might be the hardest part of the task. To find a suitable replacement, turn off the water, take the old one with you to the home center or hardware shop. (Turn off the water before removing the flapper.) You might not find an identical match, however opportunities are you'll locate among the same shape and size. If not, try a plumbing supply store (in the Yellow Pages under Plumbing Materials") or search online.</p>
<p>Water softener systems work by removing solidity minerals and changing them with sodium ions. Water conditioners are gadgets that help avoid the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale.

Water conditioners do not successfully get rid of solidity from the water supply, nevertheless, as the only method to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>
