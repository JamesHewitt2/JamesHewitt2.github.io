<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is just half the formula! To just pour some media inside a tank and wish for the very best is typical in our industry and many companies try to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Once again, years of experience and thorough testing led us to develop a tank that fluidizes the media bed much better than any other design on the market. Fluidization is the essential to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media converts the solidity in the water to calcite crystals which will not adhere to anything even under severe temperature levels. It's only with the media and the fluidization appropriately collaborating that you can attain this.</p>
