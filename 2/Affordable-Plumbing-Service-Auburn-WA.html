<p>Cold showers? High energy costs? It may be time for a brand-new hot water heater.

<p>Another drawback of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health risk for individuals on low salt diets. Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to reduce its mineral material. Normally, this process adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending on how hard the water was to start with. Harder water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this increase in sodium is minor, but if you've been encouraged by a doctor to follow a rigorous low salt diet plan this increase can pose problems.</p>
