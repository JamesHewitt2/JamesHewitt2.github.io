<p>In 1939, after his Roto-Rooter sewer cleaning machine showed effective, Sam Blanc created and built a smaller model that ran on the exact same principle but could clean and clear bathroom and kitchen sink drains as well as laundry drains and other household plumbing drains. Blanc also constructed a much larger variation of the Roto-Rooter machine called the Roto-Rooter Royal. It had to be towed by a truck and featured a 10 hp gas engine and 1000 feet of steel cable television. It was capable of cleaning big commercial and community sewer pipes. An enhanced version called "The Mainliner" was presented in 1958 that might also thread telephone cable television. It was terminated in 1973.</p>
