Such connections take place naturally in appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they should be carefully designed and installed to prevent backflow. Another common place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water system.</p>
