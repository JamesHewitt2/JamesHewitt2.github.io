Things to think about: Batch feed waste disposal unit need a bigger in advance cost. Some models run more than double the cost of continuous feed systems. And because the drain stopper prevents you from feeding scraps continually, batch feed devices may be bothersome for families with a large amount of food waste to grind.</p>
<p>You want to conserve water. Older toilets use up to seven gallons of water per flush and are much less water-efficient than newer models. U.S. Epa's WaterSense toilets use less than 1.6 gallons per flush.
