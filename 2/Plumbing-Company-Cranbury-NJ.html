Instead of a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to effectively get used to your organisation' flow rates throughout the day. During periods of high flow need, tanks come on-line to add circulation rate capability. During durations of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called progressive or responsive flow innovation, and it's probably the most essential development in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
