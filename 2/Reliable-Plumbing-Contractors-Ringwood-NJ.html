Numerous homeowners will prevent a new water heater installation service reasoning that not replacing the unit is saving them money. This is not the case in many circumstances. Most of the times, changing an old and malfunctioning  hot water heater is really more economical.</p>
<p>If you're purchasing a brand-new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast majority of toilets, the drain is centered about 12 in. from the wall. However with a couple of models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To inspect the rough-in, just measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts.
