However with a few models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, just determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in.. Many house centers bring just one or more 10-in. models and no 14-in. designs. If you have to special-order a toilet, be prepared to invest far more.

<p>Standard tank-type water heaters consist of steel cylinders that are fed by a water pipe that dips into a large storage tank. The water inside this tank is warmed up and then released into the pipes of your house through a hot-water pipe on top of the tank. Another pipe that emerges from the tank consists of the temperature level and pressure-relief valve, which opens if you go beyond a predetermined level. You'll also find a drain valve near the tank bottom, and a control unit outside for setting temperatures and managing the pilot-light valve.</p>
