<h3>What Causes Pipe and Drain Clogs in Lisle IL?</h3>
<p>In water distribution systems, water is typically maintained at a substantial pressure to allow water to flow from the tap, shower, or other fixture. Water pressure may fail or be reduced when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is all of a sudden high demand on the water supply (for instance, when a number of fire hydrants are opened). Decreased pressure in the pipe might enable contaminated water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
<p>Foul Sewer Odor: One of the first most obvious indications of a sewer concern is an odor of sewage when you flush the toilet, or in the backyard (in the area where your sewer line would be). This can be an easy problem such as a broken water seal, or it can suggest a bigger issue such as a broken sewer pipe. Drain repairs can prevent major damage to your house. Even if the problem stems with the community system, it's still clever to bring in the professionals to limit the damage to your home.</p>
