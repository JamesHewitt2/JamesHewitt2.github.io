<p>Often you know you have a sewer line break because you can smell foul smells or you have a sewage back-up in your home. It is necessary to determine the precise area of the break in your sewer line. Many times the break can be on the city side of the sewer line and knowing this can conserve you countless dollars in repairs. Simply sharing a copy of your sewer line video with the city inspector can resolve the problem.

<p>When a flush valve causes a toilet to run, a used flapper is typically the offender. But not constantly. Initially, take a look at the chain that raises the flapper. If there's excessive slack in the chain, it can tangle up and prevent the flapper from closing securely. A chain with insufficient slack can trigger trouble too. Image 3 shows how to set the slack perfect.</p>
