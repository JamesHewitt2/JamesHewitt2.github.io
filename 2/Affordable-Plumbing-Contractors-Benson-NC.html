<p>If you see rust only in your hot water, then check the status of your water heater's anode rod. If you've never done this on your own, you may need a professional to do this. The rust is most likely coming from the inside of your water heater if the anode rod is rusted out. Replace your hot water heater as quickly as possible if this holds true. On the other hand, if you see rust from both your cold and hot water taps, you more than likely have actually worn away piping.</p>

Its sole job is to prevent drinking water from being polluted due to backflow.</p>
<p>To prep your unit for installation, you may need to attach a cord with a plug to reach the outlet, or extension wires to reach a hardwired box In this case, I connected a cable with a plug set that I bought independently from the disposal unit. It's as basic as feeding the wires from the cord through the disposal and connecting them to the matching colors on the unit with wire nuts.</p>
