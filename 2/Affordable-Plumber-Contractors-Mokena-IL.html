<p>The majority of homes or buildings that were constructed in the 1970s typically have galvanized piping. Gradually, the plumbing system can break and the pipes can begin to corrode. This can trigger low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system.

As the outer covering of zinc starts to wear down, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, causing the iron to eventually rust.</p>
<p>Other signs you might need to repipe include rust in your water supply, low water pressure, and damp spots in your walls, floor, or ceiling. While these prevail signs that precede repiping services, they do not always suggest repiping is the only solution. Contact our Brenham plumbers and we will have a look at the issue to figure out the very best course of action.</p>
