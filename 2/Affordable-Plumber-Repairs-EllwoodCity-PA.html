<p>Fixing a leaky faucet appears like a simple task, however lot of times the situation can be stealthily made complex. In some cases it's best to contact a certified plumber to make sure the root cause of the leak is properly determined and addressed the first time, rather than making a number of journeys to the hardware store and purchasing a range of parts just to end up exactly where you began, or even worse, creating an even larger mess.
