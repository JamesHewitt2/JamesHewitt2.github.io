<h3>Fix a Leaky Outside Frost Free Faucet in Palmer MA</h3>
<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to operate, the control valve or valves should stay open and the system needs to be constantly monitored. For that reason, there is a device on each control valve that either prevents the valve from being closed or sends an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as simple as a locked chain through the control valve that avoids that valve from opening, or an alarm system that notifies the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems utilize both methods. NFPA 13 describes all such devices as supervisory gadgets.</p>
