<h3>Water Heater Repair Symptoms in NorthAndover MA</h3>
<p>Deterioration is a complex phenomenon and there are numerous factors that accelerate corrosion in the drinking-water circulation system and premise plumbing. For years, there has been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and deterioration, making it important to compare naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is corrosive as it has a low pH and low TDS; nevertheless, cation -exchange water softening does not add to any factors that speed up rust Also, there is an absence of scientific evidence supporting the claim that hard-water scale is an effective kind of corrosion control. Thus, considering all these factors, along with results from research study studies, WQA's position is that an effectively configured cation -exchange water softener does not make water more destructive.</p>
