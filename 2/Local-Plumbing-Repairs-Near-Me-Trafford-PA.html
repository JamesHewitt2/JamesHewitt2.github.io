<p>Loose flanges are generally the result of wood rot. The flange screws just won't keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best option depends on the extent of the rot.

Prior to you install this sort of ring, hold it approximately the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may need to cut off a couple of ears to make it deal with your toilet.
