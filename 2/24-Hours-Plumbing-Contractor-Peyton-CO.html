<p>To identify which toilet valve is causing the trouble, take a look at the overflow tube. If water is overruning into television, there's an issue with the toilet fill valve. If the water level is listed below the top of the tube, the flush valve is leaking, permitting water to drip into the bowl. That slow, consistent outflow of water prevents the fill valve from closing completely. We cut away the fronts and backs of new toilets to show you how to replace these toilet tank parts. Your toilet and toilet tank parts will not look so pristine inside. You'll find scummy surfaces, water stains and deterioration. However do not be squeamish-- the water is as clean as the things that comes out of your faucets.</p>
