<h3>Quality Plumbing Services In Irving TX</h3>
<p>The leak from a pipe fitting that costs less than a dollar can easily trigger countless dollars in water damage, interrupt your household for weeks, and toss your remodel way off schedule. So working with a licensed, insured master plumber (or a trained apprentice working under his license) is a no-brainer. However not all plumbers deal with all types of work.

<p>Duty for installation falls upon the owner of the property or the co-op or apartment board. Owners and boards of structures that are provided an order by the DEP to install a backflow preventer should submit plans with the DEP within 30 days.

Lawbreakers will be liable for a civil penalty of up to $1,000 provided by the Environmental Control Board (ECB).
