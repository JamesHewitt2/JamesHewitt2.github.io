<p>New houses constructed with copper pipes are especially vulnerable to corrosive water conditions due to the fact that the copper pipes have not had a chance to end up being covered inside. As advised by the MDH, it is best NOT to soften the water in a new home for a duration of 3 to 5 months after tenancy. This can be done by just bypassing the water softener's filter medium. See your owner's manual for directions on bypassing your softener. Numerous brand-new houses are built with PEX and not copper.</p>
