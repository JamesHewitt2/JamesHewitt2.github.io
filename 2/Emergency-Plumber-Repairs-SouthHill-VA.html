<p>The next step we must carry out in the repair process, is to flush the inbound water line. After we have cleaned the body, and the fixed components are still out of the body, and we have finished all of our part replacement and cleaning, we need to open the inlet shut off to flush any rust or debris. This can be tricky, specifically when the backflow prevention assembly is set up inside an area where water can not be wallowed. It is essential that the inlet valve be opened to flush this dirt and particles even if some sort of water collection system has to be utilized to guarantee the line is correctly flushed.</p>
<p>The easiest way to keep you and your family safe from the prospective threats of backflow through cross connections is to not produce cross connections in the very first location. Nevertheless, if you do have a cross connection to a sprinkler system system, boiler, pool, water feature or other type of cross connection, have an approved backflow prevention assembly installed.</p>

After they offered me the "do not pour grease down the sink" lecture and they left, I saw they handled to reassemble the sink in such a manner in which the sprayer hose was wrapped around the plumbing. I didn't even trouble to try calling them back, since I never want to see this company again.</p>
