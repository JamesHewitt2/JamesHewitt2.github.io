<p>As the name recommends, a backflow preventer works to ensure that liquids do not flow back versus the required instructions of circulation. When used in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is utilized to guarantee that water does not stream from the sprinkler system back into the municipal water supply, or other source of drinking water. Sadly, water held in the lawn sprinkler can become infected. If permitted to return to the water supply, there is potential for the infected water to end up being a health hazard. The backflow preventer is intended to prevent water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be checked frequently for effectiveness, as well as examined every year by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
