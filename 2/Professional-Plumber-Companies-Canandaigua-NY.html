<p>Water softeners overcome a process called ion exchange which eliminates calcium and magnesium from the water. When the hard water enters into the mineral tank, it flows through a bed of round resin beads These plastic beads, usually made from polystyrene, are charged with a salt ion. The resin beads are anions, implying they have an unfavorable charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a positive charge, making them cations. Because opposite charges attract, the negative charge of the minerals is brought in to the favorable charge of the resin beads. As the difficult water goes through the resin, the beads grab ahold of the mineral ions and remove them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the sodium ion is launched. The column of resin strips all the hardness out of the water as it passes through the mineral tank, and softened water drains into your house.</p>
