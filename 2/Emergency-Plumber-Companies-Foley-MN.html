<p>A water softener works by using electrical charges to eliminate the minerals. Calcium, magnesium and numerous other minerals carry favorable charges, so water softeners use salt ions, which are "exchanged" with the calcium and magnesium ions. If you irrigate with drinkable water, you are required to have two backflow preventers, one at the meter and another one on the watering line at the point of connection. If you have two meters, drinkable and irrigation, you are likewise needed to have 2 backflow preventers, one at each meter.</p>
