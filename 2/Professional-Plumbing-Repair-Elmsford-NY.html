<p>I had a major sewer issue with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was supporting into the basement shower. I started calling any number I could find on Google. I actually got their number for another company that couldn't come quickly enough but referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and give me a quote. They right away cleared the preliminary clog, permitting the occupants to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon additional examination, there was a substantial blockage that needed excavation to examine. His team was on website the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this preliminary issue and installing a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a 3rd time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
