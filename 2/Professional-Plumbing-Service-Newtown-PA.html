<p>And so, we see the transition from substantial transportation pipelines (aqueducts) supplying water to whole cities to large distribution pipes (mains) servicing smaller sized neighborhoods or big centers, to medium circulation pipelines and finally to small service pipelines. Each stage in the supply of water and circulation system has to handle varying circulation rates, circulation speeds and pressure heads, along with different levels of direct exposure to potential backwash or impurity seepage and the subsequent need for protection with backflow preventers.</p>
<p>A home's service line (likewise referred to as a sewer lateral) ranges from your home to the mainline sewer in the street. In most cases, the homeowner is responsible for preserving the service line from the house to the curb, and the City is responsible for maintaining the mainline sewer and the part of the service line from the mainline sewer to the curb.</p>
<p>3. Think about a hair-stopper: The number 1 reason our Thousand Oaks drain cleaning specialists are called into a home is since there is excessive hair in the shower drain.
