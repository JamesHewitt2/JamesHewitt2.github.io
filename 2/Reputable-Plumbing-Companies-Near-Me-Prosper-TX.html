<p>As discussed earlier in the article, carbon monoxide is completely odor-free and colorless. The only test for it is a carbon monoxide detector. Every home must have carbon monoxide gas detectors installed at the correct areas. In California, it is a requirement for all single and multi-family residences to have both smoke and carbon monoxide detectors. They are normally offered as a 2-in-1 detector and all brand-new installations should have a 10-year non-serviceable type of detector.</p>

When used in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is used to ensure that water does not stream from the sprinkler system back into the municipal water system, or other source of drinking water.

The backflow preventer is intended to prevent water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be checked regularly for effectiveness, in addition to examined each year by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
