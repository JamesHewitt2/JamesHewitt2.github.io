<p>A water softener is a whole-house filtration system that removes hardness-causing calcium and magnesium minerals from your water through a process called ion exchange.  A water softener addresses among the most devastating and prevalent water problems: hard water.  Tough water wreaks havoc on the contemporary house. Scale builds up in your pipes, blocking them and decreasing water pressure.  Scale drastically shortens the life-span of devices like dishwashers, coffee makers and ice makers. Difficult water damages warm water appliances. The greater the temperature level of the water, the more calcium and magnesium will harden and solidify into strong deposits inside your warm water heater.</p>
