<p>Next comes the metal mount ring and rubber cushion install (or cushion ring). Their proper orientation will be labeled. These two pieces have complementary grooves that when correctly meshed hold the mount ring and disposal in place. Holding the install ring at the topmost part of the flange, work the cushion mount over the bottom of the flange, ensuring that the rubber of the cushion install is fully and securely locking into the groove on the bottom of the flange. When installed properly, you should not have the ability to eliminate the cushion mount without considerable pulling and extending, and the install ring needs to rotate easily around it.</p>
