<p>She learnt about the service call cost. The 4 On Your Side Examination found that's a common cost. Customer Detective Jodi Brooks called around to attempt to get a price quote from private plumbers for a garbage disposal replacement. None of business we called would give a price quote over the phone. All of them wanted to take a look at the situation before committing to a cost, and all wanted to charge a service fee to come out. Brooks discovered only one plumber who would come out without charging.</p>
