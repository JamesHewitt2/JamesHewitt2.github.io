<h3>Emergency Plumbing Service And Maintenance Oakdale CA</h3>
<p>A plunger most likely will not be the best service when water increases in the bowl without stopping and spills onto the floor.

<p>Water softeners work through a process called ion exchange which removes calcium and magnesium from the water. When the tough water participates in the mineral tank, it flows through a bed of round resin beads These plastic beads, typically made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion. The resin beads are anions, meaning they have a negative charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a positive charge, making them cations. Because opposite charges draw in, the negative charge of the minerals is drawn in to the positive charge of the resin beads. As the hard water passes through the resin, the beads get ahold of the mineral ions and eliminate them from the water. When the bead seizes the mineral ion, the salt ion is launched. The column of resin strips all the hardness out of the water as it travels through the mineral tank, and softened water drains into your home.</p>
