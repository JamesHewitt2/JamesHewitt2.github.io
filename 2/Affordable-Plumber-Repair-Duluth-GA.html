<p>Rust is a complicated phenomenon and there are lots of elements that speed up deterioration in the drinking-water distribution system and facility plumbing. For years, there has actually been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and corrosion, making it essential to distinguish between naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is corrosive as it has a low pH and low TDS; nevertheless, cation -exchange water softening does not add to any factors that speed up deterioration Also, there is a lack of scientific evidence supporting the claim that hard-water scale is a reliable type of corrosion control. Hence, considering all these aspects, in addition to arise from research study studies, WQA's position is that an appropriately configured cation -exchange water softener does not make water more corrosive.</p>
