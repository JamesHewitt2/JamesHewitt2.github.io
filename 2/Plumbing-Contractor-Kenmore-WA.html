Boosts in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in potable water system pressure take place whenever the amount of water being utilized exceeds the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
