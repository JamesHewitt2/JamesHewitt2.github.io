<p>When lime is contributed to the water, it alters the water chemistry, causing the calcium to come out of the solution. The particles of calcium combine, end up being much heavier than the rest of the water and sink to the bottom of the holding basins. The clear water then moves into the next step of the treatment process. Flexible gas lines are generally more suitable to inflexible lines, especially in locations where earthquakes are more typical and for the connection in between the supply and device. Flexible gas lines are less most likely to be detached in a natural catastrophe which decreases the threat of an explosion or fire.</p>
