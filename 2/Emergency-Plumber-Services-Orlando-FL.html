<p>Once the elements are placed back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is prepared to be pressurized. It is important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the downside turned off stays in the closed position.

Many backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be removed from crucial locations in the assembly. In some models, test dicks can be used to get rid of air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in an area where the air will build up.</p>
