<p>Backpressure is developed when pressure in a water system exceeds the pressure in the drinkable system offering the makeup water. This can force the drinkable water to reverse its direction of flow through the cross-connection between the 2 systems. Prospective contaminants can then get in the potable water system. The very best way to reduce build-up is have a professional flush it a minimum of once a year. In some areas of Virginia, where the water is especially hard with high mineral material, you might need to flush the hot water heater more frequently.</p>
<p>When looking for a new flapper, your best option is to attempt and discover the very same flapper that originally included your existing flush valve.
