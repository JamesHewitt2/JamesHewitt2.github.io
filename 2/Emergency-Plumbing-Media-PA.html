However, damage such as deep fractures may require a sink replacement.</p>

After they provided me the "do not put grease down the sink" lecture and they left, I noticed they managed to reassemble the sink in such a manner in which the sprayer hose was wrapped around the plumbing. I didn't even bother to attempt calling them back, because I never want to see this company once again.</p>
