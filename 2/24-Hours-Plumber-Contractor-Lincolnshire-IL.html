When setting up the plumbing to your softener, take your time and guarantee your fittings are threaded well and your push-to-connect fittings are seated properly. It can also trigger the system to leak if the bypass valve is split. Bypass valves are fitted with -rings that may need to be re-lubricated or changed with time. A split rotor valve or rotor valve seal might also be the perpetrator. The rotor valve directs the water throughout the system throughout softening and regeneration processes. A worn water valve can lock up and spring a leak. It is likely split and simply needs to be changed if the rotor valve's seal is leaking.</p>

We supply gas hot water heater service, along with electrical water heater service, throughout Central New Jersey and the Jersey Coast.</p>
