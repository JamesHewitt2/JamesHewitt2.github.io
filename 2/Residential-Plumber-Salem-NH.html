<p>A water softener is a whole-house filtration system that eliminates hardness-causing calcium and magnesium minerals from your water through a process called ion exchange.  A water softener addresses one of the most widespread and terrible water problems: difficult water.  Difficult water wreaks havoc on the modern home. Scale builds up in your pipes, obstructing them and decreasing water pressure.  Scale significantly reduces the life expectancy of appliances like dishwashers, coffee makers and ice makers.

The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a little hole in which the water would travel through. 21 The several pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wooden pipes were used in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wooden tubes were commonly used in the U.S.A. throughout the 20th century.
