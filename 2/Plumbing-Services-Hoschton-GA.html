<p>Step 6: To connect the drain, insert the gasket in the discharge outlet. Then attach the discharge tube with the flange and bolts.

Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to investigate and provide me a price quote. They instantly cleared the initial obstruction, permitting the renters to return from a hotel.
