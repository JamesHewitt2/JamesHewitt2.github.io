For clogs that occur even more down the pipe, use a cable auger or plumber's snake. These tools are made from long, flexible steel cable television wound around a spool with a hand crank. To utilize a cable television auger, get rid of the horizontal P-trap underneath the sink, making certain it is not clogged before continuing. Take out 18 inches of cable at a time, crank the handle in a clockwise direction and press the auger forward at the very same time. Repeat the process, pulling out an additional 18 inches up until you break through the obstruction. Sometimes loose particles will settle into a brand-new blockage.
