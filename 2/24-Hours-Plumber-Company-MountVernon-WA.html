<p>Most softeners have actually a bypass built into the inlet and the outlet. By turning a valve, you can bypass the softener in case you need to provide some type of maintenance to it and even while you're working on installing it.

All of the people I came across were good example for what a well run service company need to be. Much thanks and gratitude. You're terrific.</p>
