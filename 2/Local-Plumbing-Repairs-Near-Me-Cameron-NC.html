<p>PEX pipes were thought to be a much better option to polybutylene and galvanized piping. Sadly, one brand is experiencing a lot of problems: Dura PEX. Dura PEX tends to have a lot of oxidization. This causes cracks in the tubing that can lead to leaks. As these leakages take place, zinc is seeped from the fittings on the pipes, causing them to degrade. Lastly, chlorinated water has been found to trigger cracks in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the very best option to all of these issues.</p>
<p>All backflow preventers should be tested each year and after repair, relocation, or replacement by a State of Washington certified Backflow Assembly Tester (BAT).

These heaters typically last more than 20 years.</p>
