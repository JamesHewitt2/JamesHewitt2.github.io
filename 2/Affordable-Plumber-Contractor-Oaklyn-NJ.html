Points at which a drinkable water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in devices such as clothing washers and dishwashers, however they need to be thoroughly developed and set up to prevent backflow. Another typical location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>
