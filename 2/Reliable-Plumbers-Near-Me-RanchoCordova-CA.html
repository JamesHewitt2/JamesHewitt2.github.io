<p>A pressure vacuum breaker (PVB) is considered a testable backflow preventer, however it is also really unusual. They were manufactured so as to give the plumber a testable vacuum breaker device.

<p>This is a fantastic company with outstanding professionalism, quality of work, and customer service. While their rates are very competitive, their work doesn't feel low-cost like some of the companies you can employ of off Craigslist or on a FB yard sale page.

<p>A minimum of as soon as every three months, drain water from the tank. Over time sediment develops at the bottom of the heater, which can hamper efficiency, and draining pipes a gallon or so helps get rid of the sediment. If you spot a leak and choose a patching job rather of a repiping task, simply keep in mind that all the pipes in your house are most likely made from the same product and they may be next. To avoid further, more-costly repairs (like water damage from burst pipes), you may want to consider repiping your whole home when you spot a leak.</p>
