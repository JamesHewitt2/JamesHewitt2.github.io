<p>Waste disposal unit units might cost more when they have to suit local water and sewer capacities.

<p>Loose flanges are usually the result of wood rot. The flange screws just will not keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best option depends upon the extent of the rot. Utilize an ear-type repair ring if the rot is only under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into company wood farther away from the flange. Prior to you install this sort of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might need to cut off a couple of ears to make it deal with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll have to replace an area of the subfloor.</p>
