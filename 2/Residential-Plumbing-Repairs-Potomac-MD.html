<p>A water softener is a whole-house filtration system that eliminates hardness-causing calcium and magnesium minerals from your water through a procedure called ion exchange.  A water softener addresses among the most prevalent and devastating water problems: difficult water.  Difficult water damaged the modern home. Scale builds up in your pipes, obstructing them and reducing water pressure.  Scale dramatically reduces the lifespan of appliances like dishwashing machines, coffee machine and ice devices. Hard water ruins warm water devices. The greater the temperature of the water, the more calcium and magnesium will strengthen and solidify into solid deposits inside your warm water heater.</p>

<p>Water softeners work through a procedure called ion exchange which eliminates calcium and magnesium from the water. When the hard water enters into the mineral tank, it flows through a bed of spherical resin beads These plastic beads, generally made from polystyrene, are charged with a salt ion. The resin beads are anions, suggesting they have a negative charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a positive charge, making them cations. Considering that opposite charges attract, the unfavorable charge of the minerals is attracted to the positive charge of the resin beads. As the tough water goes through the resin, the beads grab ahold of the mineral ions and eliminate them from the water. When the bead seizes the mineral ion, the sodium ion is launched. The column of resin strips all the hardness out of the water as it travels through the mineral tank, and softened water drains into your house.</p>

<p>Wood pipes were used in London and somewhere else during the 17th and 16th centuries. The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a little hole in which the water would pass through. 21 The multiple pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wooden pipes were used in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wood tubes were extensively utilized in the U.S.A. during the 20th century. These pipes (used in location of corrugated iron or enhanced concrete pipes) were made from areas cut from brief lengths of wood. Locking of nearby rings with wood dowel pins produced a flexible structure.
