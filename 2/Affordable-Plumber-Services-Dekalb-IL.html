<h3>Quality Plumbing Service Dekalb IL</h3>
<p>The leak from a pipe fitting that costs less than a dollar can easily cause thousands of dollars in water damage, interrupt your household for weeks, and toss your remodel method off schedule. So working with a licensed, insured master plumber (or a well-trained apprentice working under his license) is a no-brainer. However not all plumbers handle all types of work. Their duties break out into 2 classifications: Plumbers who manage fundamental repairs (frequently in emergency scenarios), and plumbers who focus on redesigning tasks and additions.</p>
<p>Water softeners work through a procedure called ion exchange which removes calcium and magnesium from the water. When the difficult water participates in the mineral tank, it streams through a bed of round resin beads These plastic beads, generally made from polystyrene, are charged with a salt ion. The resin beads are anions, implying they have a negative charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a positive charge, making them cations. Because opposite charges attract, the negative charge of the minerals is attracted to the positive charge of the resin beads. As the difficult water passes through the resin, the beads get ahold of the mineral ions and eliminate them from the water. When the bead seizes the mineral ion, the sodium ion is launched. The column of resin strips all the solidity out of the water as it goes through the mineral tank, and softened water flows out into your home.</p>
