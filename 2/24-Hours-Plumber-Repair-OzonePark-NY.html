<p>The main media included within a water softener is called ion exchange resin. This resin is basically an insoluble matrix normally in the shape of small (1-2 mm diameter) beads. The material has highly established structure of pores on the surface of which are sites with easily trapped and released ions. This process of trapping of ions occurs with a simultaneous releasing of other ions resulting in the term ion-exchange. Ion exchange resins can be manufactured to selectively prefer one, or perhaps several different types of ions. Usually, these resins are based on cross-linked polystyrene.</p>
