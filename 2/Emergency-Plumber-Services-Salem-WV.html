<p>If there is backflow at your house, you could pollute your drinking water with non-treated water from an irrigation canal or water pooled around a sprinkler head that has fertilizer on it. Also, if you utilize your hose to fill a wading pool or jacuzzi, a reversal of the water flow could siphon pool or health club chemicals back through the garden hose and into your house's plumbing.</p>
