<p>House water softeners, likewise called ion exchange systems, are devices that get rid of calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for salt or potassium.

After passing through the beads, the resulting chloride solution ends up being a waste stream that goes down the drain and eventually into the environment.</p>
