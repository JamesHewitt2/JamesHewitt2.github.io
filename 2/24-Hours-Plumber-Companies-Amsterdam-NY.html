<p>The toilet takes a really long period of time to flush. Here's how it works: During normal operation, the pressure in between the 2 check valves-- referred to as the zone of decreased pressure-- is maintained at a lower pressure than the supply pressure. If either check valve need to leak, the relief valve is developed to open and discharge water to the outdoors, making sure backflow never ever occurs.</p>
<p>Repiping is not a temporary fix. It's a long-term solution for the whole plumbing system in your home or service. We switch off the supply of water, eliminate old pipe and replace it with new pipe. After the brand-new system is installed, we turn the water on and carry out tests on the brand-new system. When the system passes our tests, it's great to go for you.</p>

After softening a large quantity of tough water, the exchange medium becomes layered with calcium and magnesium ions. The exchange medium need to be recharged or regrowed (Figure 1)when this occurs.
