<p>A water conditioner, on the other hand, manages tough water concerns in a more ingenious method. It can change the way minerals behave while liquified in the water.

Just pour a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, include some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mixture sit for a while. If that does not work, you can attempt a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner. A number of these cleaners contain focused levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be very damaging if it is available in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. Please make certain to take the proper safety measures if using one of these products.</p>
