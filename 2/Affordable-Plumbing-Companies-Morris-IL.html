<p>I had a major sewer problem with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was supporting into the basement shower. I began calling any number I could discover on Google. I actually got their number for another company that could not come soon enough however referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and provide me a quote. They immediately cleared the initial blockage, allowing for the tenants to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon more investigation, there was a significant blockage that needed excavation to investigate. His group was on website the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this initial concern and setting up a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a 3rd time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
