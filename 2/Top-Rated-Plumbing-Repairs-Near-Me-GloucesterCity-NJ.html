<p>In local water system systems, water is typically maintained at a substantial pressure to make it possible for water to flow to and out of the plumbing fixtures in your house or organisation. When the pressure drops for some reason such as may occur when the fire department links to a fire hydrant to fight a fire or a water main breaks or some other situation occurs, infected water may be drawn into the system. To prevent such an occurrence, there needs to be some type of backflow prevention approach made use of. The very best and best type of backflow prevention is an air space (a physical separation in between the water outlet and the rim of the component). If an air space is not possible, then the proper backflow prevention device is needed. This backflow device is considered a containment" backflow preventer and is regulated by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency and your water provider.</p>
