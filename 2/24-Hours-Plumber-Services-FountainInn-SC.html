<h2>Tips To Hire Certified Plumbing Companies in FountainInn</h2>

<p>Concealed water leakages are often difficult and have Potentially Serious Repercussions. Replacing your flapper may require somewhat various actions than we show (Photos 2 and 3). Your flapper may screw onto a threaded rod or have a ring that slips over the overflow tube. If you have an unusual flush valve, discovering a replacement flapper may be the hardest part of the task. To discover a suitable replacement, shut off the water, take the old one with you to the home center or hardware shop. (Switch off the water before getting rid of the flapper.) You might not find a similar match, however chances are you'll find one of the same shape and size. If not, try a plumbing supply shop (in the Yellow Pages under Plumbing Supplies") or search online.</p>
