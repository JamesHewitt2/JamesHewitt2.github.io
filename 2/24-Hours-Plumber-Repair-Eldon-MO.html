<p>Other pipe repair techniques include our Pipe Pull strategy and pipe relining. The Pipe Pull method interchanges damaged sewer or water lines with brand-new piping by the use of a tiny hole at the front and back of the piping run. The broken sewer line guides the new piping into location. All brand-new replacement pipes have actually a predicted life expectancy of one a century and are code compliant, chemical-resistant, root-resistant, and leak evidence.
