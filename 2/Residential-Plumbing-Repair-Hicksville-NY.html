<p>Your sewer line is one of the most important parts of your household plumbing - and if it ends up being damaged or clogged, it might wreak undesirable issues on your property. Water heater repair can often be cost-prohibitive. You'll pay for the necessary repairs just to deal with another problem quickly thereafter. No matter what kind of hot water heater you have or have an interest in, the experts at Timothy Off can help. Contact us today for our hot water heater installation services. For instance, if your kitchen sink is backed up since you flushed potato peels down the disposal, a fast drain snaking can separate the blockage and send it down the pipes. We recommend you choose drain snaking instead of utilizing strong chemical drain cleaners. These store-bought cleaners may do more damage than good by corroding your pipes.</p>
<p>We had a fantastic experience with Joe Boyette, he was really professional, polite, competent. We had a lot of plumbing repair after a fire for over a 2 month period. We also had to replace a bathroom and a water heater unrelated to the fire, but we felt great in Joe's capabilities. We decided to stay with Joe, despite the fact that we felt Mr Rooter rates were certainly on the high end. This being published by Barbara Boyer from Atlanta.</p>
