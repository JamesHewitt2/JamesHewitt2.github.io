<p>Deterioration is an intricate phenomenon and there are lots of aspects that speed up deterioration in the drinking-water distribution system and premise plumbing. For many years, there has actually been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and corrosion, making it essential to compare naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is destructive as it has a low pH and low TDS; however, cation -exchange water softening does not contribute to any factors that accelerate corrosion Also, there is an absence of scientific proof supporting the claim that hard-water scale is an efficient form of rust control. Hence, considering all these elements, in addition to results from research studies, WQA's position is that an effectively set up cation -exchange water softener does not make water more corrosive.</p>
