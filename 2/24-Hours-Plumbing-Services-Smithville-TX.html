<p>If you reside in an older home with older pipes and such then you will begin to experience a clean out duration. Depending upon water use, this can take up to 90 days. FutureSoft softener will really break down and the clean the within your pipes and heating components. As this takes place, you will experience a boost in identifying anywhere water evaporates. You will primarily see this in the shower, counter tops, shower heads, and faucets. We advise you flush your hot water heater after the very first month of use.</p>

If you look behind your toilet, you'll see a supply line that ranges from the outlet in the wall to the bottom of the toilet fill valve. This is how water enters your toilet. After you flush the toilet, the fill valve opens to fill up the water in the tank and the toilet bowl, readying the system for the next flush. If your fill valve is broken, not set at the correct level, or isn't installed correctly, you might experience a frequently or constantly "running" toilet - which can cost you hundreds of dollars in lost water.</p>

<p>Water softeners work through a process called ion exchange which eliminates calcium and magnesium from the water. When the tough water participates in the mineral tank, it streams through a bed of round resin beads These plastic beads, typically made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion. The resin beads are anions, implying they have an unfavorable charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a favorable charge, making them cations. Because opposite charges attract, the negative charge of the minerals is brought in to the favorable charge of the resin beads. As the tough water goes through the resin, the beads grab ahold of the mineral ions and remove them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the salt ion is released. The column of resin strips all the hardness out of the water as it travels through the mineral tank, and softened water flows out into your home.</p>
