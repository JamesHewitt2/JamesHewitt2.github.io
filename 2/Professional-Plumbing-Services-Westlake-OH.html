<p>As soon as the parts are placed back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is ready to be pressurized. It is very important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the drawback shut off stays in the closed position. This enables the parts to relocate to their pressurized positions in an exact motion. When the assembly is pressurized, then any built up air should be eliminated from the body. Most backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be eliminated from critical locations in the assembly. In some models, test cocks can be utilized to remove air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in an area where the air will collect.</p>

<p>Throughout regular operation, the pressure in between the two check valves, referred to as the zone of minimized pressure, is preserved at a lower pressure than the supply pressure. If either check valve should leak, the relief valve is created to open and release water to the outside. An RPZ will regularly release small amounts of water due to variation in line pressure up or downstream of the assembly. For this reason, the RPZ needs to be set up in areas that are exempt to water damage and permit adequate drainage.</p>
